Written by
John Waters
Fourth Draft: 1 June 1998
1. Film opens with beautiful shot of the skyline of
downtown Baltimore in the spring. Credits begin.
Cut to "The Hippodrome Theater," one-time downtown movie
palace, now abandoned and boarded up with broken and
blank marquee. The credits to our movie continue by
fading in on marquee.
Cut to thriving "Harbor Court" theaters, downtown
chain. All six marquees list the same two
mega-budget Hollywood hits. Hollywood titles fade
out and "Cecil B. DeMented" title logo fades into
marquee in all its terrorist glory.
Cut to old "Towson Theater." A "FOR RENT" sign is
on marquee of this one-time neighborhood theater.
"FOR RENT" sign fades out and our credits fade in
on marquee.
Cut to "Towson Commons," a modern cineplex down the
street. All the titles listed on marquee are
sequels. Sequel titles fade out and our credits
fade in on marquee.
Cut to "5 West Theater," one-time art house. The
marquee now announces "Sunday Church Service" which
fades out and our credits continue, fading in.
Cut to "Westview Mall," suburban multiplex, all
the titles listed on marquee are recent Hollywood
comedy bombs. The Hollywood titles fade out and our
credits fade in.
Cut to "New Theater," once a popular downtown premiere
spot. The marquee reads C-L-O-S-E-D in badly spaced
letters. The letters fade out and our credits fade in.
2. Cut to wide shot of EXTERIOR SENATOR THEATER, 2.
Baltimore's landmark art-deco movie palace. Marquee

BENEFIT MARYLAND HEART FUND
HONEY WHITLOCK
IN
"SOME KIND OF HAPPINESS"
Marquee letters fade out and our credits fade in.
Cut to blocks of cement out front of the theater similar
to Grauman's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles. Each
displays the logo of a film title that was shot on
location in Baltimore and premiered at this theater;
"Diner," "The Accidental Tourist," "And Justice For
3
All." Our credits are intercut in the cement blocks as
the camera pans across this local tourist attraction.
Cut to SINCLAIR STEVENS, the handsome but intense
20-year-old theater manager as he adjusts the final
letter of the film's title on the marquee, perched atop
a ladder. SINCLAIR is dressed in an obviously rented
tuxedo and for a moment seems like any other middle
class suburban kid.
ROY STILLINGS, the tuxedoed fifty-year-old theater
owner, shouts instructions from below as CATERERS,
DECORATORS and PUBLICITY PEOPLE rush in an out of
theater preparing for tonight's event. He is
surrounded by several of his young staff - DINAH, the
sourpussed but unconventionally striking cashier;
CHARDONNAY, the African-American ticket-taker with a
huge 90's hairdo so popular with the black girls in
Baltimore; RAVEN, the happy and always smiling pretty
usherette, and FIDGET, the dweebish but somehow sexy
janitor. All have made an attempt to dress up their
usual uniforms for the premiere.
MR. STILLINGS
A little more to the right,
Sinclair.
SINCLAIR
(Moving the final "S"
IN "HAPPINESS")
That better, Mr. Stillings?
Title on marquee fades out and "Produced by..." credit
fades in.
MR. STILLINGS
(SQUINTING)
Yeah, that's good.
(STILL UNSATISFIED)
But try moving the "K" in "Whitlock."
A little to the left.
SINCLAIR
(Following his boss's instructions,
the "Some Kind Of Happiness" title
back on the marquee)
Have you met her yet?
MR. STILLINGS
Not yet. But don't worry,
Sinclair, I'll introduce you!
SINCLAIR
You promise?
SINCLAIR smiles sneakily to himself as "Some Kind Of
Happiness" logo fades out on marquee and "Written and
Directed by John Waters" credit fades in.
SINCLAIR
(EVILLY)
I'm a bg fan!
End of credits.
3. Cut to EXTERIOR HARBOR COURT, luxury downtownhotel. 3.
Movie fans of all ages, clutch 8x10's of Honey
Whitlock and eagerly await her departure.
4. INTERIOR "PRESIDENTIAL SUITE" OF HARBOR COURT HOTEL. 4.
HONEY WHITLOCK turns from beautiful Inner Harbor view
outside hotel window and we see she is about forty
years old and a complete knockout.
HONEY
Ah, what a town!
HONEY is dressed for the premiere in an elegant evening
gown and her black hair is cut perfectly in the Louise
Brooks style that has become her signature. She
continues her press conference under the watchful eyes
of her press agent CHARLES and her long-time assistant
LIBBY, both of whom are also dressed for the premiere.
ROOM SERVICE employees stand by, ready to serve.
HONEY
I tell everybody in Hollywood,
when you shoot on location in
Baltimore, you don't need to
bring all the crew from Los
Angeles. Baltimore really ia the
best!...
5. Cut back to INTERIOR LOBBY OF SENATOR THEATER. 5.
MR. STILLINGS lectures his other staff members as
CATERERS and BARTENDERS set up behind him. SINCLAIR
STEVENS is paying close attention as is LYLE, the
projectionist, a handsome but surprisingly gaunt young
man. CHERISH, a sexy and slightly nasty candy-counter
girl leers at SINCLAIR who flirts back as she feigns
interest in MR. STILLINGS' pep talk. PAM the popcorn
girl, a masculine but beautiful nineteen year old with a
seemingly bad attitude and LEWIS, the young cool
African-American usher with a chip on his shoulder join
FIDGET, RAVEN and DINAH.
5
MR. STILLINGS
and remember, Miss Whitlock
is every inch a movie star and
expects to be on stage at exactly
7:10pm to ensure live coverage
from all three local news shows.
By the way, I hear she's really
a nice person...
6. INTERIOR HONEY'S HOTEL ROOM. 6.
HONEY's mean face glares out window at the twinkling
lights of Baltimore's Inner Harbor in the early
evening.
HONEY
Look at this dump of a town!
HONEY turns to her long suffering assistant, LIBBY.
The press is gone and they are alone.
HONEY
Get me the fuck back to L.A. If
one more asshole mentions a crab
cake to me, I think I'll puke.
LIBBY
(Trying to be positive)
Did you try the steamed crabs?
They're red and...
HONEY
No I didn't! I'm not interested
in any kind of meal you have to
beat with a mallet...
A knock is heard at hotel door.
HONEY
(SUDDENLY NICE)
Just a minute...
(Muttering to herself as
LIBBY goes to answer door)
.wearing some stupid kind of bib
while families of mutants gawk in
my face ...No thank you!
CHARLES, the press agent enters.
CHARLES
Your limousine is here, Miss
Whitlock. You look beautiful.
HONEY
(Back to being gracious)
Thank you Charles, darling. We'll
be right with you. I'm excited.
CHARLES exits.
HONEY
(Back to her nasty self)
Do you think Pat Nixon got
fucked in this hotel room?
LIBBY
(STUPEFIED)
Well ...I don't know...I mean...
HONEY
It's called the "Presidential
Suite" isn't it?
LIBBY
Yes...but...
HONEY
I BET SHE DID! Call the
manager and ask him!
LIBBY
(HORRIFIED)
I can't ask that. . .Pat Nixon
was a stroke victim...
HONEY
It's your ï¿½ to ask, Libby!
Call downstairs and find out
if Pat Nixon got fucked in my
hotel room! I want to know!
7. EXTERIOR SENATOR THEATER. 7.
Large crowd of fans and gawkers let out a roar of
approval as the klieg lights are switched on by WORKMAN
and the night sky is lit up by the criss-crossing beams
of light.
8. INTERIOR HALLWAY OF HARBOR COURT HOTEL. 8.
HONEY WHITLOCK, looking incredibly glamorous, is being
led downstairs by CHARLES, the press agent and RODNEY,
a young biker-type bodyguard assigned to her for the
night by the theater. He wears an ill-fitting polyester
suit and an earphone. LIBBY hurries to catch up with
them.
7
LIBBY
(Reading from notes)
The hotel manager said "No."
Pat Nixon never stayed here,
but Nancy Reagen did in 1986...
HONEY
(AMAZED)
You didn't actually ask him?
LIBBY
(CONFUSED)
You said to call downstairs...
HONEY
(APPALLED)
You asked the hotel manager if
Pat Nixon had sex in my room?
LIBBY
Well. . .sort of. I mean you
told me...
HONEY
I was kidding Libby. He must
think you're a complete lunatic!
Good God, you'd do anything!
A HOTEL MAID pushing a cart of towels and bathroom
supplies comes around a corner and is completely
star-struck.
MAID
Good luck, Miss Whitlock!
HONEY's face freezes in horror as elevator doors
open and she is led inside.
9. INTERIOR ELEVATOR. 9.
Several well-dressed hotel guests recognize HONEY
and are thrilled.
HONEY
(In a sudden tirade)
Did you hear what that little
bitch said to me?
LIBBY
She didn't know.
HONEY
In show business we say "break a
leg." NEVER fucking "Good Luck"!
8
HOTEL GUESTS frown in disappointment at HONEY's
language.
LIBBY
(TO HONEY)
That's just an old superstition.
CHARLES
(NERVOUSLY)
Miss Whitlock, there's photo cps
with the mayor in the lobby...
HONEY
That cocksucker put a curse
on my whole fucking premiere!
HOTEL GUESTS let out a cry of shock at HONEY's
language.
10. INTERIOR HOTEL LOBBY. 10.
MAYOR FENWICK, the middle aged African American mayor
waits with the PRESS.
HONEY steps off the elevator completely composed to a
burst of flashbulbs.
HONEY
Mayor Fenwick!
LIBBY and CHARLES look to one another relieved as
HOTEL GUESTS stumble out of elevator, shaking their
heads in disgust.
MAYOR
Miss Whitlock, what an honor!
They pose together as PRESS snaps away.
HONEY
I love what you've done with
this city.
MAYOR
And Baltimore loves you back!
(Takes out proclamation)
I, Adam Fenwick, Mayor of the
City of Baltimore, do hereby
proclaim April 29th to be Honey
Whitlock Day in Maryland and do
command this observation to all
of our citizens. Whereas...

SINCLAIR nods gravely to LYLE the projectionist who
picks up a 35mm metal film can and sneaks up behind
MR. STILLINGS who is looking down from projection
booth to the premiere CROWD filling the theater below.
MR. STILLINGS
Christ, there's what's-her-name
from E Network. Look at the
tits on her!
