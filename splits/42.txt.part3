Yeah?
RICKEY'S VOICE
Hello, Leo, what are you doing?
DUROCHER
I'm bowling. Wait, I'm snowshoeing
in the Alps. I'm trying to sleep,
Mr. Rickey. It's still dark out.

RICKEY
Another spring training is upon us.
In Panama. I need to know your
attitude toward Jackie Robinson.
72 INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING: 72
DUROCHER
I don't got an attitude toward him.
The girl rolls over to look at him. She is the actress
LORRAINE DAY and she is stunning. As Durocher regards her...
RICKEY
Eight times in the Bible we're told
to love our neighbor. It's one of
God's most repeated commands.
PINK REV 4-19-12 50.
She puts her hands on him. (Durocher addressing Rickey.)
LORRAINE
(SOFTLY)
Hi...
DUROCHER
I don't know much about the Bible.
LORRAINE
Me neither...
DUROCHER
But I didn't go to school just to
eat my lunch either. I'll play an
elephant if he can help us win. To
make room for him, I'll send my own
brother home if he's not as good.
LORRAINE
(in his ear)
What are you going to do with me?
DUROCHER
We're playing for money, Mr.
Rickey. Winning's the only thing
that matters. Is he a nice guy?
RICKEY
If by nice you mean soft, no, not
particularly.
DUROCHER
Good. He can't afford to be. Nice
guys finish last.
LORRAINE
What about nice girls?
She starts to kiss him. It's hard to concentrate.
RICKEY
So you have no objections to him?
DUROCHER
None whatsoever. Can I go back to
sleep now?
RICKEY
Yes. Oh -- and Leo?
DUROCHER
What?
PINK REV 4-19-12 50A.
RICKEY
The Bible says a thing or two about
adultery as well.
DUROCHER
I'm sure it's got a lot to say
about a lot. Good night.
Durocher hangs up the phone, looks to her.
DUROCHER
What am I gonna do with you?
LORRAINE
Leo, I thought you knew...
As she kisses him...
CUT TO:
73 EXT. PEPPER STREET - PASADENA - DAY 73
Jack stands out front kissing Jackie Jr. good-bye as a CABBIE
muscles his LUGGAGE down the walkway to a waiting TAXI. Jack
kisses Mallie and hands off the baby. Mallie carries the boy
inside leaving Jack and Rachel alone to say goodbye.
BLUE REV 4-07-12 51.
RACHEL
Promise me you'll write.
JACK
When did I ever not write?
RACHEL
I want you to know I'm there for
you. Even if it's words on paper.
He's sees she's raw, takes her in his arms with the baby.
JACK
Rae, you're in my heart.
She sighs, rests her head on his shoulder.
RACHEL
You're getting close now. The
closer you get, the worse they'll
be. Don't let them get to you.
JACK
I will not. God built me to last.
He kisses her. She kisses him back.
RACHEL
See you in Brooklyn in eight weeks.
JACK
It might be Montreal.
A certainty grips her. She passes it on to him.
RACHEL
It's going to be Brooklyn. I know
it is.
Power in her words. He nods, looks off toward the taxi.
JACK
I've got to go, Rae.
She nods. They kiss, embrace a last time. He starts away
down the walk. She watches. Something not quite right.
A tug as Jack stops, looks back at her. Fighting back her
emotion and then impelled forward, she runs to him. They
come together. She practically disappears in his arms. They
do not want to be apart.

Durocher eats heartily. Rickey's food is untouched.
DUROCHER
It's a pipe dream, Mr. Rickey.
RICKEY
Pipe dream? What do you mean by
pipe dream?
INSERT: Panama City, Panama. March 18, 1947.
DUROCHER
I mean it ain't gonna happen. The
Dodgers are never gonna demand
Robinson be brought up from
Montreal. Ball players are
conservative.
RICKEY
A team full of tough war veterans?
Immigrants' sons? Boys from
impoverished parts of the country?
DUROCHER
It - ain't - gonna - happen.
RICKEY
You really believe they won't
accept him? Once they see how he
plays, how he can help them win.
DUROCHER
I'm not saying they won't accept
him: I'm saying they won't ask for
him. I'm saying Robinson's good
medicine, but they're not gonna
like the taste. I'm saying bend
over, boys, and get ready, this one
might hurt a little.

Boy, this is good fish.

As Higbe (South Carolina) finishes WRITING something on a
piece of hotel STATIONARY, Bragan (Alabama) looks to Dixie
Walker (Alabama) and Dodger pitcher HUGH CASEY (Georgia).
BRAGAN
Why do you think Rickey's got us
playing spring games in Panama?
(MORE)
BLUE REV 4-07-12 53.
BRAGAN (CONT'D)
He wants to get us used to Negro
crowds. He wants more of them than
us. He's hoping it'll get us more
comfortable being around Robinson.
Higbe clears his throat, reads what he's written:
HIGBE
We, the undersigned Brooklyn
Dodgers will not play ball on the
same field as Jackie Robinson.
Higbe signs it. He hands the pen to Bragan who adds his own
name. Casey signs with a flourish. Casey holds out the pen
to Walker who doesn't take it right away. An odd beat.
CASEY
If you wanna make your mark, Dixie,
we can witness it.
Everyone laughs; it loosens Walker up enough to sign.

waist, soaking his right elbow in a BUCKET OF ICE.
STANKY
What's goin' on?
HIGBE
Got a petition goin' on, Stank.
BRAGAN
To keep Robinson up in Montreal
where he belongs.
STANKY
Oh... Did Pee Wee sign it?
HIGBE
Ain't asked him yet. What
difference does it make?
STANKY
None, just wonderin'.

Can't sign now. I'm indisposed.
Could I catch up with you later?

Standing in the door to his room. Looking out at the glum
faces of Higbe, Bragan, Casey and Walker.
REESE
Look, it's like this. I got a

I don't want to step in anything.
(TO WALKER)
Skip me, Dix, I'm not interested.
WALKER
What if they put him at shortstop?
REESE
(SHRUGS)
If he's man enough to take my job,
I suppose he deserves it.
HIGBE
(laughs out loud)
The hell he does!
WALKER
He does not have the ice water in

REESE
So let him show what he's got.
Robinson can play or he can't.
It'll all take care of itself.

Have our friends in the press gone

DUROCHER
We are the only people awake on

Deserted. Durocher stands in a hotel bathrobe, arms crossed
as his PLAYERS and COACHES file in. Bleary-eyed, half-
dressed, they're all here, all wondering what this is about.
Suddenly, Durocher grabs the handle of an industrial-sized
SOUP POT and heaves it across the room. BRWANG-RANG-RANG!
DUROCHER
Wake up, ladies! Wake the Hell up!
(a stunned beat)
It's come to my attention that some
of you fellas don't want to play
with Robinson. That you even got a
petition drawn up that you're all
gonna sign. Well boys, you know

YOU CAN WIPE YOUR ASSES WITH IT!
WALKER
C'mon, Leo...
DUROCHER
Come on what?!

DUROCHER
Screw your hardware store, Dix!
And if you don't like it, screw
you! Mr. Rickey'll be happy to
make other arrangements for you.
Durocher suddenly marches to Higbe, looks like he's going to
belt him. As Higbe gulps, Durocher turns to the team.
DUROCHER
I don't care if he's yellow or
black or has stripes like a zebra,
if Robinson can help us win, and
everything I've seen says he can,
then he's gonna play on this ball
club. Like it, lump it, make your
mind up to it because he's coming!
And think about this when your
heads hit the pillow, he's only the
first, boys, only the first. More
are coming right behind him. They
have talent and they wanna play!
He lets that sink a moment.
DUROCHER
Yes, sir, they're gonna come diving
and scratching. So I'd forget your
petition and worry about the field.
Because unless you fellas pay a
little more attention to your work,
they are going to run you right out
of the ball park! A petition?

JACK
What do you want me to do with

SUKEFORTH
Play first base.
JACK
I've never played first base in my
life, Coach.
SUKEFORTH
Well, it's like this. Brooklyn's
got a solid second baseman. And
they got Pee Wee Reese at short.
But first base is up for grabs.

PANAMANIAN KID

SUKEFORTH
Mr. Rickey said he wants you
playing conspicuous baseball!

To be so good the Dodgers'll demand
you on the team!

So I thought about it awhile and

Bragan, most of your teammates have
recanted on this petition nonsense.
Are you really here to tell me you
don't want to play with Robinson?
BRAGAN
Yes, Sir. My friends back in
Birmingham would never forgive me.
RICKEY
And your friends here in Brooklyn?
(Bragan just shrugs)
Then I will accommodate you. If
you give me your word that you will
try your very best for this team
until I can work out a trade.
That gets Bragan's goat. He jumps up, really mad.
BRAGAN
Do you think I would quit on

Only on yourself apparently. You

Time slowed way down as Jack takes a throw at second from the
Montreal shortstop. He pivots to turn the double-play even
as Dixie Walker barrels in low.
All Jackie's focus on the task at hand as he throws while
Walker submarines him. He lands in a heap tangled up
together. They both look back to see the result of the play.

Recently, the thought has occurred
to me that a change of ball clubs
would benefit both the Brooklyn
Baseball Club and myself.
(TO WALKER)
This is about Robinson?
WALKER
I'm keeping my reasons private.
Hope you can respect that, sir.
RICKEY
I realize, Dixie, that you have a
Southern upbringing, that you would
have to subordinate your feelings
for the welfare of this venture. I
for one would deeply appreciate it.
I think we can all learn something.
WALKER
What I have, Mr. Rickey, is a
hardware store back home. It's
called Dixie Walker's. Folks don't
come because I have the lowest
prices, they come because it's
called Dixie Walker's. Understand?
And I make as much money owning
that store as I do playing for you.
RICKEY
Is that what you're you afraid of?
(he doesn't answer)
Bragan's a third-stringer, but you
bat clean-up. You're popular in
Brooklyn. Children look up to you!
WALKER
You got my letter; can I go?
RICKEY
I'll start looking for a trade or a
sale. But it won't happen until I
get value in return. Until then I
expect you to drive in runs.

your mind?
Jack stares out the passenger window, not in the mood. As he

My daddy used to work at Fair Lane.
That was Mr. Ford's estate. My
daddy was Mr. Henry Ford's cook.
SMITH âAS JACK'
I did not know that.
SMITH
Cooked for him for years, but never
once broke bread with him. I'd go
to work with daddy sometimes. Play
baseball out on the lawn with Mr.
Ford's grandchildren. We all had a
real good time. But it was
understood, if they got tired of
playing ball and moved inside to
the bowling alley or swimming pool,
I was not invited or allowed. The
grass was as far as I got. So
guess what? You're not the only
one with something at stake here.
JACK

If I start talking, will you stop?
SMITH
I'd be happy to.
Smith stops at a red light.
JACK
I apologize. You've been there for
me through this more than anyone
besides Rae and Mr. Rickey. But I
guess that's what bothers me.

How do you mean?

I don't like needing someone to be
there for me. I don't like needing
anyone but myself. I never have.

You remember the last time we were

Organization. Vowing a ban on
baseball unless Durocher is
punished for his moral looseness.
