S and an ARM
breaks out through a shell, GRABBING HER LEG. Audrey
FREAKS and frantically she KICKS herself free. They both
suddenly take off running.
189  INT. MID-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                             189
Nick and Raymond race to the stairwell. Raymond pulls
out his radio.
RAYMOND
(into radio)
Everyone, outside! Now!
ANGLE - JEAN-CLAUDE - MID-LEVEL DECKS - ACROSS THE ROOM
Laying down the plastic explosives. Hearing the radio,
he drops what they're doing just as several eggs near
them begin to CRACK. Quickly he and his partner take off
running.
190  INT. FAR BACK WALL - LOWER LEVEL - SAME                    190
Two other men are still laying cables for the
explosives. One of them is kneeling in a pile of FISH
near the eggs.
R-MAN #2
Come on, let's go.
R-MAN #3
One moment. I've almost got this.
Just then a BABYZILLA pops up behind the eggs, a fish in
his mouth. He SWALLOWS the fish and begins SNIFFING THE
AIR. He turns and stares directly at the slowly
retreating R-MAN #3.
He smells his own hands and realizes he smells like
fish, quickly he turns and RUNS.
But Babyzilla is faster. He runs up from behind and
LEAPS onto R-MAN #3's back. R-MAN #2 begins to FIRE at
Babyzilla just as another one TACKLES HIM from the
side.
In moments, they are both devoured.
191  INT. TEAM ENTRANCE - FLOOR-LEVEL - SAME                    191
Audrey and Animal reach the entrance and race inside.
The main exit doors are locked from the outside. They
turn back just as...
THREE BABYZILLAS
appear in the team entrance doorway SNIFFING THE AIR.
Audrey SEES something, grabs Animal's wrist and pulls
him to one of the Locker room doors. It's open.
192  INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              192
Through the door we SEE the Babyzilla approaching as
Audrey and Animal leap inside, slamming the door behind
them. There is a sudden THUD against the door.
Animal rushes over to a large LOCKER CABINET and, with
all his strength, PUSHES it over, blocking the door.
AUDREY
Great. Now what do we do?
193  INT. HALLWAYS - MID-LEVEL - SAME                           193
Nick and Raymond run up to another open doorway and look
inside.
NICK'S P.O.V. - AUDITORIUM
Dozens and dozens of eggs HATCHING. BABYZILLAS
everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to
devour all the fish. A Babyzilla appears only feet away
and turns and stares directly at us.
Quickly Raymond slams the doors shut as they both
retreat back into the hallway. Raymond SMASHES the glass
covering of a nearby FIRE HOSE and raps it around the
door handles, locking it closed.
Suddenly a loud THUD as something begins to BANG against
the locked doorway.
RAYMOND
We've got to lock them inside while we
can.
Raymond tosses his cellular phone to Nick.
RAYMOND
Contact the military and get them to
send a bomber to blow up this building
before these things escape.
NICK
How do I do that?
RAYMOND
555-7600. Tell them it's a code
dragonfly. They should get you
through.
Amazed by Raymond, Nick just stares at him.
RAYMOND
What are you waiting for?
Nick snaps out of it and dials.
OPERATOR
(filtered)
...all circuits are busy right now.
Please hang up and try again...
194  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT               194
A large and ANGRY mob has gathered at the roadblock to
the bridge. People, their cars packed with belongings,
are screaming to be let back into Manhattan. Horns honk
and the blockade guards are getting nervous.
195  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           195
The Mayor marches over to Major Hicks who is consulting
with the Generals.
MAYOR
Do you have any idea what's going on
out there? The phones are ringing off
the hook with people screaming to be
let back into the city.
MAJOR HICKS
We're sending divers into the river
now to retrieve the body.
MAYOR
That thing's dead. What the hell are
we waiting for?
Just then Elise rushes over to the Major.
ELSIE
Major, if Nick is right, this could be
our last chance to do something about
it. We have to search for the nest,
now.
Major Hicks is torn. Finally he nods in agreement,
turning to another officer.
MAJOR HICKS
Organize a search party. I want a
complete sweep of the entire city and
subway system.
MAYOR
You don't have the authority to do
that.
The Major turns and cooly approaches the Mayor.
MAJOR HICKS
Try and stop me.
Major Hicks smiles at the Mayor who exits, petulantly.
196  INT. AUDITORIUM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - DOORWAY -        196
NIGHT
We SEE dozens and dozens of Babyzillas fighting with
each other over the last of the fish. Suddenly this
image is SLAMMED SHUT as doors are closed and a FIRE
HOSE is rapped around door handles. We widen to
reveal...
Raymond fastening the hose around the door. Secured,
Raymond takes off running.
197  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - HALLWAY - SAME                197
Nick is on the pay phone frantically dialing as Raymond
comes up. We hear a BUSY signal from the phone. Nick
dials again.
RAYMOND
What'd they say?
NICK
I can't get through. I don't know
what's wrong.
OPERATOR
(filtered)
...all circuits are busy right now...
Jean-Clude and his partner arrive.
JEAN-CLAUDE
We've secured the doors on both
levels.
RAYMOND
Where's Luc and Pierre?
JEAN-CLAUDE
They didn't make it.
RAYMOND
(quickly recovering)
Nick, my men and I will hold them
here. You will have to go and get
help!
Nick nods in agreement and takes off down stairs. The
rest of the team SNAP TOGETHER their automatic rifles
and prepare for a fight.
198  INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME                                    198
Animal and Audrey are checking out every corner of the
room.
ANIMAL
There's got to be another way out of
here.
Audrey climbs up onto a table and yanks out a grate
covering the air vent.
AUDREY
Think we can fit up in there?
ANIMAL
Only one way to find out.
He rushes over to her and helps her climb up inside.
199  INT. FLOOR-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                           199
Jean-Claude sends Luc up ahead as they guard the
doorways. A loud THUMP is heard on the door they are
guarding. Each turns their weapon towards the doors.
Suddenly a portion of WALL BETWEEN THEM COLLAPSES.
A DOZEN BABYZILLAS leaping through the plaster. As they
spill out into the hall, Jean-Claude attempts to open
FIRE. One of the Babyzilla's is HIT.
His brothers ATTACK. Luc from the other side tries to
lay down cover fire but he's overrun by the herd.
200  INT. HALLWAY - MAIN LOBBY LEVEL - SAME                     200
Nick comes racing down the stairs and into the hallway.
Just then, he passes a locked door, BANGING on the other
side.
Just up ahead he can SEE the main lobby. But before he
can get there, a LOUD CRASH is heard as the locked door
in front of him SMASHES TO BITS as...
DOZENS OF BABYZILLAS
Flood into the main lobby only a few yards ahead. Nick
slams on the breaks and quietly tries to back away. He
turns to run the other directions when...
MORE BABYZILLA
Come BURSTING THROUGH the locked door behind him. Pinned
down with no way out. Nick SEES the elevator nearby and
races over, slamming his hand against the button.
NICK
Come on, come on.
The Babyzillas by the front door spot Nick. A couple of
them start to SNIFF THE AIR and start to move towards
him. Behind, the Babyzilla also catch the scent and
turn.
NICK
This is not good.
Just then the elevator doors open, Nick LEAPS inside.
201  INT. ELEVATOR - SAME                                       201
Nick frantically pushes the CLOSE DOOR button but it's
painfully slow to react.
NICK
I hate these things!
Just then the Babyzillas appear. They're just about to
move in when the doors finally CLOSE. Nick breaths a
sigh of relief just as a loud THUD is heard as one of
them SLAMS against the door. It's too late, the elevator
begins to rise.
202  INT. AIR VENT - SAME - NIGHT                               202
Climbing upward, Animal reaches a plateau and crawls
into cross vent. He reaches back and grabs his camera.
Putting it down he turns back and helps Audrey up and
in.
ANIMAL
You okay?
Out of breath, she nods. Animal takes the lead again,
pushing his camera in front of him. He reaches another
vent that looks down. He's about to pull it free when
something catches his eye.
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - THROUGH VENT - RAYMOND
Standing guard, automatic rife in hand, Raymond appears
with his back toward us. Animal lifts his camera to
shoot.
AUDREY
(whispered)
What? What is it?
Animal doesn't answer, he just shoots.
203  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        203
The elevator doors open and Raymond SWERVES his gun
around ready to shoot. Frightened, Nick throws his hands
in the air.
NICK
Hey, it's me!
204  INT. VENT - SAME                                           204
Audrey has pushed her way up alongside of Animal to peer
down through the grating.
RAYMOND
What happened?
205  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        205
Nick keeps dialing the cell phone, still busy.
NICK
They're loose. They're allover the
main lobby. I couldn't get out.
Just then the vents above COLLAPSES and Animal and
Audrey come tumbling down. In a flash, Raymond has his
weapon trained on their heads.
RAYMOND
Who the hell are you?
NICK
It's okay. I know her.
Raymond turns his gun towards the fallen video camera
and FIRES, ripping the camera apart.
ANIMAL
Hey! What gives?
RAYMOND
No cameras.
Nick moves to Audrey's side, helping her up.
NICK
What are you doing here?
AUDREY
I thought you said there'd only be a
dozen eggs.
NICK
I was wrong.
Just then a LOUD THUMP is heard against the near locked
door. The THUMPING gets louder and heavier.
RAYMOND
Do you have a radio, a walkie-talkie?
Anything we can use to contact the
outside.
AUDREY
What about the phones?
NICK
Circuits are overloaded.
AUDREY
(gets an idea)
I know a way. I know how you can get
a message out of here.
The door BURSTS OPEN and TWENTY BABYZILLAS stampede into
the hallway. Audrey is fast on her feet.
AUDREY
This way.
She takes off running and they follow. The Babyzillas
give chase. Animal, hangs back and runs over to the
destroyed video camera and PULLS OUT THE TAPE. Just as
he does, the Babyzillas are nearly on top of him. He
dashes off.
ANGLE - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR
Audrey gets there first and opens the small doorway that
leads to a back stairwell, she ushers the rest inside.
She slams the door behind her as the Babyzillas appear
and begin to SNIFF the doorway.
206  INT. HALLWAY - LUXURY BOXES - SAME - NIGHT                 206
They spill out into the hall and rush past all the
luxury boxes overlooking the auditorium.
AUDREY
Come on, the broadcast booth is right
over here.
NICK
How do you know?
AUDREY
Our network covers the Ranger games.
207  INT. MID-LEVEL - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR                   207
The Babyzillas are gathered by the doorway SNIFFING. One
of the more aggressive ones starts to CLAW at the door,
RIPPING into it. Another charges it, THUD.
208  INT. LUXURY BOX HALLWAY - SAME                             208
They rush up to a door marked BROADCAST BOOTH. Audrey
tries the door, it's locked. Animal charges his shoulder
into it, but it doesn't give.
Raymond gently moves Animal out of the way and SHOOTS
the lock to pieces. He opens the door for everyone to
enter.
209  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        209
They rush into the empty broadcast booth. Animal turns
on the lights as Audrey goes over and boots the computer
terminal. Raymond moves some equipment against the door,
securing it closed.
AUDREY
The network is on an intranet. It's a
direct feed into our computer system.
NICK
Your station won't have any easier
time contacting the military than I
did.
That stumps her. Animal gets an idea.
ANIMAL
When you worked with them, did they
monitor the news broadcasts?
NICK
(getting the idea)
Yes, they did.
ANIMAL
We'll go live! We'll broadcast from
here. Hopefully they'll see it.
210  INT. MID-LEVEL - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR                   210
More of the creatures have gathered by the door. Two
more CHARGE and the door collapses. The Babyzillas rush
up the stairs.
211  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - EDITING BAY - SAME                  211
Ed is watching the news feed. Caiman is on.
CAIMAN
(filtered)
...Yes, the threat is over but the
pain continues...
Suddenly Ed's computer begins to BEEP. Ed slides his
chair over and looks at his monitor. It reads NEW MAIL:
URGENT! He double clicks it and a letter pops up that
reads. Ed pick up transponder CFX 1 and watch the feed.
ED
(to himself)
There's no Ranger game on tonight.
Ed makes a couple of adjustments on his controls and
turns on a blank monitor. He SEES...
C.U. MONITOR - AUDREY
Racing in front of the camera we SEE Audrey in the
control booth.
AUDREY
...If you're seeing this, Ed, please
put us on Live! This is urgent! I know
this sounds crazy Ed but you have to
do it. Please, trust me.
ED
(incredulous)
I'm not putting you on live!
212  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                212
Nick turns on a small television and we still SEE Caiman
doing the news. Audrey turns to Animal.
AUDREY
He's not going to do it.
ANIMAL
Oh yes he will.
Animal turns the camera and points out the window at the
BABYZILLA'S below.
213  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - SAME                                213
Ed's eyes nearly pop out of his head.
AUDREY

Ed, you see that? They'll be all over
the city if we don't stop them!
Ed rushes over to the console and goes to work.
214  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   214
The mode is festive.  The Generals are preparing to leave
as is Major Hicks. Sergeant O'Neal and some of his men
are watching the t.v. news.
CAIMAN
(filtered)
...as our fears have been allayed
thanks to the dedicated work of our
boys in uniform...
Everyone in the room begins to cheer. Suddenly Caiman's
image goes fuzzy. In a moment it's replaced by Audrey.
AUDREY
(filtered)
Are we on? Are we live?
215  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                215
Nick SEES Audrey on the t.v. and gives her the thumbs
up.
AUDREY
We're live from inside Madison Square
Garden where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has
discovered the beasts lair. Doctor,
tell us what is happening here.
Animal swerves the camera over to Nick. Raymond stays
back behind the camera, watching.
NICK
We've discovered over two hundred eggs
which began hatching only moments ago.
216  INT. LUXURY BOXES HALLWAY - SAME                           216

A Soldier tugs on Major Hicks shoulder, try to get his
attention.
MAJOR HICKS
What is it?
SOLDIER
You better see this.
The Major turns around just in time to SEE Nick on the
t.v.
NICK
If the military are listening, they
must immediately destroy this building
before they can escape.
AUDREY (O.S.)
Oh my God! They're coming!
The camera SWERVES to SEE through the luxury booths
across from them, the dozens of Babyzillas approaching.
218  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     218
The bedroom is packed with Lucy's "guests" as they watch
the t.v., SEEING the Babyzillas.
LUCY
Oh my God!
On the screen the image turns to Nick.
NICK
(filtered)
If those creatures escape and
multiply, in a very short time a new
species will emerge. One that could
replace us as the dominant species of
this planet.
219  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   219
Major Hicks is on the phone.
MAJOR HICKS

That's correct, I want you to blow up
Madison Square Garden. No I'm not
drunk.

Contact the news station. Tell them
we're on the way.

LUCY
That's my girl.
222  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                222
Animal lowers the camera and everyone is silent.
NICK
Thanks, Audrey.
The computer beeps, Animal reads the message.
ANIMAL
The good news is they got the message.
The bad news is we've got five and a
half minutes to get out of the
building.
Suddenly the room ROCKS as the Babyzillas begin crashing
against the blocked door. Raymond jumps to his feet.
RAYMOND
Okay, party's over. Time to leave.
With that he SPRAYS bullets into the front glass window
SHATTERING IT. Glass rains down below. Raymond tosses
the spool of cable out the broken window.
RAYMOND
Anyone care to join me?
Animal dislodges one of the video cameras, hoists it on
his shoulder and moves over to join Raymond.
223  EXT. AIR BASE - F-18 SQUADRON - SAME - NIGHT               223

Audrey and Nick are nervous as they stare at the long
drop down. The door is begging to give way from the
repeated THUMPING. Suddenly Audrey leans over and kisses
Nick.
AUDREY
In case I can't later.
With that she JUMPS out, repelling downward. Nick is
stunned by the unexpected kiss. Suddenly the door GIVES
and the Babyzilla FLOOD into the room. Nick jumps.
226  INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS                               226
Audrey hits the ground followed by Nick. Raymond leads
as they make their way out.
On the other end of the room some Babyzilla appear in a
doorway and watch our friends scurry away. The
Babyzillas take off in hot pursuit.
227  INT. DARK SKIES - F-18 SQUADRON - NIGHT                    227

228  INT. FLOOR-LEVEL HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                    228
Raymond, guns in each hand, comes rushing into the
hallway. He SEES a small group of Babyzillas down the
hall and gestures for the group to go the other way.
Raymond backs away, guns trained on the Babyzillas who
SNIFF the air and decide to pursue. Raymond turns and
runs.
ANGLE - FARTHER DOWN HALLWAY - AROUND THE CORNER - SAME
As they tear forward they nearly run smack into a heard
of several dozen Babyzillas who are tearing the
concession stands to ribbons looking for food.
Spotted, the Babyzillas LEAP forward after the team.
Raymond spots the escalators across the hall.
RAYMOND
The escalators, hurry!

beautiful MANHATTAN SKYLINE approaching.
230  INT. ESCALATOR CORRIDOR - MADISON SQUARE - SAME            230
The team races into the corridor. Animal reaches down
and hits the POWER button near the moving stairs. The
escalator comes to life.
The team runs down the "down" escalators as the
Babyzillas flood into the corridor. Some try to go down
the "up" escalator and fall all over themselves. Others
are spooked by the moving down escalator. Finally, the
brave ones begin to LEAP down the "down" escalator.
231  INT. MAIN LOBBY HALLWAY - SAME                             231
Racing out of the escalator corridor the team moves into

Like the scene in Hitcock's "The Birds" it is eerily
still as everyone freezes.
