a better look at the savage fight.
The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.
CALVIN CANDIE.
The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
him today. What's his name, Moguy?
MOGUY
Big Fred.
CALVIN CANDIE
The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.
(TO AMERIGO)
What's your nigger's name?
AMERIGO
Luigi... .?
Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender
named, ROSCOE tends it.
CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
a good bit of fun?
DJANGO
You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.
CALVIN CANDIE
How'd you two like to try the signature drink
of the club?
79
Dr.SCHULTZ
We'd love to.
CALVIN CANDIE
(yelling to the
BARTENDER)
Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and
don't spare the rum.
Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
Big Fred kills Luigi.
Candie and his friends cheer.
CALVIN CANDIE
Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
like you owe me ten dollars.
Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a
sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.
Candle turns his attention to Django.
CALVIN CANDIE
What's your name, boy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO SCHULTZ)
Where'd ya dig him up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
A fortuitous turn of events brought
Django and myself together.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO DJANGO)
I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a
real bright boy.
(BEAT)
I'm curious, what makes you such a
mandingo expert?
DJANGO
I'm curious, what makes you so curious?
Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;
BARTHOLOMEW
What you say, boy?
77
/ï¿½. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.
CALVIN CANDIE
Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
you directed your line of inquiry to me.
CALVIN CANDIE
Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
Dr.SCHULTZ
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
didn't seek you out for your advice. I
sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.
I was'under the impression when you
granted me an audience, it would be to
discuss business.
CALVIN CANDIE
No we weren't talking business yet. We
were discussing my curiosity.
Now according to Moguy here, if I do
business with you...
(POINTING TO
SCHULTZ)
, .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.
(POINTING TO
DJANGO)
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
but more or less, yes.
None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
Candie turns his attention back to Django.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO DJANGO)
So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
looked over my African flesh, and were
none too impressed.
FLASH ON
we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..
BACK TO CLEO CLUB
DJANGO
Not for top dollar.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well then we got nothing more to talk
about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
from me, those are the beat ass niggers
I wanna sell.
DJANGO
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
sell. He wants the nigger you don't
wanna sell.
CALVIN CANDIE
I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
sell.
Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;-
Dr.SCHULTZ
You won't sell your best. You won't even
sell your second best. But your third
best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
forced to consider it... . who knows what
could happen?
CALVIN CANDIE
What do you consider ridiculous?
Dr.SCHULTZ.
For a truly talented specimen,
."The Right Nigger"..:?
How much would you say, Django?
DJANGO
Twelve thousand dollars.
Calvin Candle takes in the figure.
CALVIN CANDIE
Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
you got my attention.
TIME CUT
TNT -- CLEOPATRA CLUB -- RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Candle, Moguy, Django, Schultz, Bartholomew, Sheba, and Coco eat dinner
in the restaurant. All the men eat thick T-Bones. Coco eats Catfish.
And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads.
77
CALVIN CANDIE
How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?
Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO COCO)
How's your Catfish, dew drop?
COCO
Real good Monsieur Candie.
CALVIN CANDIE
(TO SCHULTZ)
You spend a lot of time around niggers
aside from Freeman here?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Not so much.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
treat this was for 'em. You feel special
Coco?
COCO
Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.
CALVIN CANDIE
You feel special Bartholomew?
BARTHOLOMEW
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?
SHEBA
Yep.
CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
special?
DJANGO
(MEANING SHEBA)
Not as special as her.
The table breaks out in laughter.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well we're leaving bright and early
tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
You oughta come with us.
Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so good.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
suppose I could be amenable to that.
How far must we trek?
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
There you can get a look at my best
specimens. Have dinner with my sister
and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
my guest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.
WE CUT
EXT - COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to
"Candyland."
Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE OVERSEERS
(BILLY CRASH, TOMMY GILES, and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled
with'supplies.
FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus JOSHUA,
SIDNEY JAMES, and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction
walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal
possessions under their arm. They look like powerful warriors.
THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY, CHICKEN CHARLY, CHESTER) WHO
WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are
walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate is
pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win, like
with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs.
J
RODNEY
walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All the
slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver. But
the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.
FLASH ON
Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three.
RODNEY
gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.
DJANGO ON TONY
sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let
that shit stand.
He yells down to the powerless man;
DJANGO
Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
Rodney looks away.
RODNEY
No sir.
DJANGO
You want a boot heel in it?
RODNEY
No sir.
DJANGO
Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
Flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give ya reason not to like me!
As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but
not without difficulty.
Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How do you like this side of the slave
trade?
DJANGO
Not so much.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Prefer the other side?
DJANGO
I didn't say that.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.
DJANGO
Are you sure it's her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
He didn't call her by name, but she's a
young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
assume, in this instance, I think it's
pretty safe.
DJANGO
Did you offer to buy her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I opened the door to my possible interest.
But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
so interested.
SUDDENLY ...
Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...
CALVIN CANDLE
Am I intruding?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Of course not.
CALVIN CANDIE
(APPRAISING THE
TWO MEN)
I swear you two are cozier then a couple
of cuttle fish.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You'd be surprised what a good
conversationalist Django is.
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh by now, I don't think that would
surprise meat all.
Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
When do we reach your property?
1?3
CALVIN CANDLE
You been on it. I own the whole sixty
miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.
CALVIN CANDIE
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
(YELLING BEHIND
him at Billy)
Billy Crash, git up here!
Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth,
rides up.
BILLY CRASH
Yeah, Boss?
CALVIN CANDIE
Find out what that goddamn commotion
is up at the tracker shack!
BILLY CRASH
Right away, Boss.
Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.
CALVIN CANDIE
You know, confidentially, just 'tween
us girls, worse things about this
business, ain't the slaves. It's all
the white trash ya gotta deal with.
Like these peckawoods we got riding with
us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
And don't think they don't know it either.
It's about the only thing these dumbass
motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
niggers ass, other than somebody might as
well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
patience, that German lady taught Hildi
how to speak German.
Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his
ï¿½, emotions betray nothing.
PTE
CALVIN CANDIE
(CON'T)
Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
Billy Crash comes riding back.
CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell's goin on?
BILLY CRASH
They got 'em a runaway.
CALVIN CANDIE
Who?
CUT TO
EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY
A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway
slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation.
A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the
bunkhouse.
The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty
long haired lot.
Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and
JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons,
or just from the same hollow.
Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of
MARSHA.
A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt,
surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him.
One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
patch.
O V5
The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look
down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three
old mandingos who know D'Artagnan.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
a fool thing like run off?
D'ARTAGNAN
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
myself think!
Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha;
Mr.STONESIPHER
Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
(to the other
TRACKERS)
Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
he's just makin' em hungry.
The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.
CALVIN CANDIE
How long was he loose?
Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice.
Mr.STONESIPHER
A.night. Day. Half the other night.
CALVIN CANDIE
How far he git off property?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
considering that limp he got.
CALVIN CANDIE
Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
Friday?.
MOGUY
(pointing behind him)
One of this new lot.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.
(TO D'ARTAGNAN)
Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
a tail on a teddy bear.
D'Artagnan starts begging.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
business. Now I done paid five hundred
dollars for you. And when I pay five
hundred dollars, I expect to get five
fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
and play dead. You've fought three fights.
D'ARTAGNAN
I won every one.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
muddied the line between winning and losing.
Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway
on the ground.
CALVIN CANDIE
But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
dollars, I want five fights. So what
about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
reimburse me?
The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of D'Artagnan to
know what to expect from their new home.
Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor
bastard.
Calvin prods further.
CALVIN CANDIE
You even know what reimburse means?
E 17
The Whites laugh.
Then SUDDENLY ...
.The German Speaks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'll reimburse you.
All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the
direction of the good German.
CALVIN CANDIE
You will?
Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes.
CALVIN CANDIE
You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
broom?
Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.
DJANGO
No he won't.
All eyes turn to Django.
DJANGO
He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
right, Doc?
Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached
to Django you can never do..BREAK CHARACTER. The doctor puts his
billfold back in his suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(TO CANDIE)
You heard 'em.
The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the
green jacket, slack jawed.
!` Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.
CALVIN CANDIE
You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
Mr. Stonesipher?
Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS.
Mr.STONESIPHER
That's right.
Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black man,
Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.
CALVIN CANDIE
Well now since you won't pay a penny for
this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger however I see fit?
DJANGO
He's your nigger.
CALVIN CANDIE
Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Marsha...git 'em!
The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German
Shepherds back.
The DOGS CHARGE towards D'Artagnan on his knees...
THE MANDINGOS
all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
The DOGS ATTACK D'ARTAGNAN ...
As we HEAR the ATTACK ...
Candie.staring contest with Django...
Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't blink as
the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ...
The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he
appears not to enjoy it.
Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr.Schultz, then back
ï¿½-. to Django.
P9
CALVIN CANDIE
Your boss looks a little green around
the gills for a blood sport like
nigger fightin'?
As D'Artagnan's SCREAMS and Marsha's GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.
DJANGO
Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
ripped apart by dogs, is all.
CALVIN CANDIE
But you are use to it?
DJANGO
Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
a little more use to American's then
he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
ready, we rode five hours so you could
show off your stock. Let's git to it.
Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
ain't impressed.
Calvin...BLINK...
Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on
his horse, then looks at the black man.
CALVIN CANDIE
Follow me.
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
apart.
EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
picking it.
The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
Django.
90
All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to
get a better look at the black riding a horse.
Django looks back matching their stare.
EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
(very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
among his SHEEP.
KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
begins tossing them about.
The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.
THEN ...
.DJANGO rides by.
The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
same village.
And they too see Django ... . WOW!
The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
or The Big House as everyone calls it.
To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
night nigger fights.
All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
famil
