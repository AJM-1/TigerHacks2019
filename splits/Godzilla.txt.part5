 The guard approaches Raymond, checks
him out.
GUARD
You got a problem talkin'?
RAYMOND
(perfect southern accent)
Why no sir, I'm fine.
The Guard is suspicious but on a tight schedule. Finally
he waves him through.
GUARD
All right, keep it moving.
RAYMOND
(ala Presley)
Thank you very much.
They drive off. Nick is stunned by the act.
RAYMOND
Elvis Presley movies.
(by way of explanation)
He was the King!
137  INT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - MAINTENANCE DOOR - SAME - NIGHT      137
The door creeps open. Animal leans out to find the
tunnel deserted. He and Audrey step out and into the
tunnel. We FOLLOW them as they are headed for the exit
of the tunnel into Manhattan.
138  INT. RAYMOND'S HUMVEE - NIGHT                              138
Raymond and Nick drive through Central Park. We can SEE
dozens of military people and vehicles in a large
meadow.
139  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LARGE MEADOW - NIGHT                   139
The enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the
center of the field as many others are planting land
mines. Tanks, rockets and soldiers align the area.
The convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but Raymond
and his men keep going straight. They drive slowly right
past the trap sight and out of the park.
TIRES SQUEALING TO A STOP
Doors slam and immediately boots march past. We WIDEN to
reveal Raymond's team quickly gathering their gear and
heading down the subway entrance.
Raymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to Nick who
nearly topples from the weight.
RAYMOND
Be careful with that.
Nick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked
EXPLOSIVES. Shocked he looks back at Raymond, but he's
gone. Nick regains his breath and follows.
THE FISH
Older and nastier, but the same fish we saw in the
tunnel before. We FOLLOW the beam to its owner and find
Nick. We WIDEN to reveal that we're....
140  INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT                 140
The crisscrossing beams from the assault team's
flashlights nearly blind us as Nick leads the team
cautiously into the depth of this tunnel. Periodic fish
are found along the way. Suddenly the faint HUMMING
sound in the tunnel STOPS.
Everyone freezes as the wind shifts direction. A
familiar SMELL passes over them as they sniff the air.
NICK
They've turned off the ventilation
system. They're calling him to
dinner.
RAYMOND
Let's hope we are not the hors
d'oeuvres.
Nervously they continue onward.
141  EXT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             141
Animal and Audrey arrive, spotting the assault team's
vehicles. They head carefully down the stairs.
142  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             142
Audrey and Animal, camera in hand shooting everything,
climb down into the station. Animal rushes to the end of
the platform and searches down into the tunnels.
VIDEO P.O.V. - DARK TUNNEL - DISTANT LIGHTS
Through the camera we SEE the lights in the distance of
the tunnel.
ANIMAL
(whispering)
They're down there. Let's go.
Animal jumps off the platform, down onto what's left of
the tracks. Audrey squeamishly follows.
143  INT. TUNNELS - NICK & TEAM - SAME - NIGHT                  143
Nick kneels down to inspect some debris. An old
SCREECHING SOUND is heard in the distance. Suddenly the
ground begins to quake. Dust falling. The SCREECHING
gets louder and louder.
Raymond moves up to Nick and points ahead. Nick nods in
nervous agreement. Just as they move towards the sounds
the ENTIRE WALL OF THE TUNNEL COLLAPSES next to them.
Bursting through the tunnel wall GODZILLA appears. His
enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and
into the tunnel. Quickly he moves past the team.
The team DIVES into a cross tunnel just as the colossal
beast BLASTS past them, barely missing them.
144  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - TUNNEL ENTRANCE          144
Audrey and Animal have just gotten into the tunnel
entrance. The entire place is shaking. Audrey is in a
panic.
AUDREY
Animal, let's get out of here.
But Animal hoists his camera and starts filming as
SOMETHING is moving TOWARDS them. Audrey is tugging at
him as the shaking gets more violent. With all her
strength, she finally gets Animal to start moving
backwards.
Just as they're out of the tunnel, the CREATURE BLASTS
outward. Audrey and Animal DIVE into the maintenance
ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision.
ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL
Animal is shielding Audrey with his body. She looks up
just in time to SEE Godzilla CRAWLING UP and out through
the ceiling. An amazing site.
AUDREY
Shoot! Shoot it!
Animal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it
disappearing from view. Once gone, they both break into
enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter.
145  INT. TUNNEL - SAME                                         145
Recovering, Raymond and the team walk back into the main
tunnel. They near the hole Godzilla just created,
examining it. Nick climbs into the hole.
NICK
I guess we go this way.
Raymond and his men follow.
146  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                146
Major Hicks is at the radio as the Generals sit behind
him.
MAJOR HICKS

Sergeant, status?
147  INT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           147
The park is bathed in light. Armed troops surround the
area. Tanks and missile launchers are in place. Sergeant
O'Neal kneels down by a sandbag fortification.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
(into radio)
Any sign of it?
148  EXT. ROOFTOP - SPOTTERS - SAME - NIGHT                     148
From the rooftop of one of the central park south high
rises, a team of SPOTTERS scan the area.
SPOTTER P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - GODZILLA
Moving steadily towards central park, Godzilla makes his
way up seventh avenue.
SPOTTER
Got him. Section 5, heading north to
target.
149  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME                 149
The Sergeant gives the nod and several teams of shooters
take off running, taking positions. The tanks turn their
gun turrets towards downtown, expectantly. Missile
launchers turn, arming devices locked.
150  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                150
Major Hicks stands near a computerized schematic of
Manhattan. A large RED FLASHING BLIP nears Central
Park.
151  EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - GODZILLA - SAME                      151
Godzilla moves up 7th Ave. He reaches Central Park South
and STOPS. He glances over to the park where bright
lights are glaring.
Something is making Godzilla more cautious this time.
Unsure he vacillates between moving forward and staying
within the shelter of the tall buildings.
ANGLE - O'NEAL - CENTRAL PARK
SERGEANT O'NEAL
(into radio)
Don't fire until he's cleared the
buildings and has moved into the
park.
ANGLE - GODZILLA
Still unsure, he ROARS out, frustrated with his own
indecision.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
Come on, come on!
152  INT. TUNNELS - SAME - NIGHT                                152
Nick leads the team through the cross town tunnel
created by Godzilla. Climbing over the debris, they make
their way to another opening. We FOLLOW them as they
clamber through the hole and into...
153  INT. PENN STATION - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                     153
The largest subway/rail station in New York. Godzilla
has torn it to shreds. We get the feeling this is where
Godzilla has spent most of his time. Scattered fish
abound.
High above, there is a immense black hole in the tall
ceiling. Wherever it leads to is very dark. Nick and
Raymond stare at the hole together.
RAYMOND
What is up there?
154  EXT. 34TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER - SUBWAY ENTRANCE -       154
NIGHT
Climbing the stairs out from the subway, Nick et all
walk up onto the street to SEE...
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
The team cautiously approaches the building.
155  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           155
Carefully moving out from between the buildings Godzilla
takes a step into Central Park.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
(into radio)
Prepare to fire!
Guns are cocked, locked on and hoisted. Suddenly
Godzilla gets cold feet and starts to turn around.
156  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                156
The RED BLIP suddenly begins to move away from the
park.
MAJOR HICKS
(into radio)
Damn it! Fire! Shoot it before it gets
away!
157  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           157
SERGEANT O'NEAL
Fire at will! Fire at will!
All the weapons surround the area FIRE AT ONCE. Several
more Cobra Helicopters ZOOM DOWN out of nowhere.
Plunging downward, they FIRE at Godzilla.
The firepower ripping up everything around him, Godzilla
ROARS and deftly DIVES out of the park and back between
the buildings.
But as he bounds over to 57th street, there is a
contingency of MOBILE ROCKET LAUNCHERS waiting. They
FIRE. Godzilla DODGES and the rockets DESTROY PLANET
HOLLYWOOD as Godzilla races by.
With the helicopters right on his tail, Godzilla makes a
westward run across 57th street. Smashing parked
vehicles and his tail SWIPING buildings as it DASHES.
WEST SIDE HIGHWAY
Godzilla is heading straight for it, the helicopters
SHOOTING from the air. Suddenly Godzilla LEAPS higher
than we've seen before. He hurls himself OVER the West
Side Highway and SPLASHES DOWN into the Hudson River,
vanishing beneath the water's surface.
158  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                158
Furious, Major Hicks throws his headset against the
console violently. ADMIRAL JOHNSTON leans down into
frame.
ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
Don't worry. The Navy has a little
something there waiting for him.
THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES
In the murky waters of the Hudson river.
159  INT. NUCLEAR SUBMARINE - THE ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT        159
The alarm KLAXONS are RINGING OUT as everyone rushes to
battle stations. The CAPTAIN moves over to a sonar
screen; a large MASS nearby blips on the screen.
CAPTAIN

161  INT. LOBBY - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME - NIGHT          161
The doors are pried open. It's very dark in here, only
the assault team's flashlights illuminate. As they enter
the lobby, the team splits up into different search
groups.
Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude move down the large front
lobby and turn down one of the many hallways surrounding
the main auditorium.
ANGLE - HALLWAY - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS
Cautiously they move towards us. In the distance we see
the rest of the team moving the other direction. Raymond
and Nick arrive at a door leading to the main
auditorium. Nick is about to push the door open when
Raymond stops him.
RAYMOND
Jean-Claude.
On command, Jean-Claude snaps together his automatic
rifle as Raymond pulls out his semi-automatic pistol. He
nods "okay" to Nick who slowly opens the door.
As the door opens a small pile of FISH tumbles down over
their feet. They step over the fish and enter.
162  INT. AUDITORIUM - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT         162
Total darkness. Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude cautiously
step over the fish inside. Only their flashlight beams
can be seen.
NICK'S P.O.V. - TRASHED AUDITORIUM
His beam cruises over the area nearby. It's been gutted.
Fish lay strewed on the floor everywhere. Suddenly Nick
spots a strange cluster of OBJECTS. He moves closer.
Raymond follows. With their combined light we can
SEE...
THREE ENORMOUS EGGS
A pile of reptile eggs nearly twice as tall as they are.
Raymond walks behind the egg, illuminating it from the
other side, making it partially translucent. We can SEE
THE EMBRYO inside the egg and IT'S MOVING!
NICK
Three eggs. I thought there would be
more.
RAYMOND
You were right.
Slowly Nick turns and SEES what Jean-Claude is staring
at open jawed...
DOZENS OF EGGS
Together their beams of light scan across the main
auditorium floor surrounding the gaping hole to discover
DOZENS OF EGGS piled in clumps everywhere.
NICK
That can't be. That's got to be over
twenty eggs.
163  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          163
Another of Raymond's men (R-MAN #2) has found a

AUDREY
Okay, where'd they go from here?
165  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          165
R-MAN #2 locates the switch he's looking for and hits
it.
166  INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME - NIGHT                             166
Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude are stunned as the work
lights suddenly TURN ON illuminating the room,
revealing...
HUNDREDS OF EGGS
All over the main auditorium floor. A stunning tableau.
Nick is speechless. Raymond turns to him.
RAYMOND
Start counting.
167  INT. PENN STATION - SAME                                   167
The light filters down from the gaping hole in the
ceiling.
ANIMAL
They must have climbed all the way up
into there.
Together they notice some large metal piping that has
fallen from the auditorium. They move over to it and
begin to climb.
168  EXT. UNDERWATER - HUDSON RIVER - NUCLEAR SUB - NIGHT       168
The Arizona races past us.
169  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                169

172  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  172
The torpedo is FIRED and comes darting directly at
Godzilla who abruptly SWERVES. The torpedo, however,
FOLLOWS him.
ANGLE - SUBMARINE - CALVIN COOLIDGE
From the other direction, closing in. Godzilla DIVES,
skidding close to the bottom. The TORPEDO begins to
close the gap.
Suddenly Godzilla SHOOTS UPWARDS heading directly for
the underside of the Calvin Coolidge.
173  INT. CALVIN COOLIDGE SUB - BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT           173
The Calvin's CAPTAIN rushes over to the sonar screens.

174  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME                          174
Godzilla RAMS the underside of the Calvin Coolidge
before she can turn. The entire sub SPINS, TWISTING OVER
its side and colliding directly with...
THE TORPEDO
slams into the side of the rolling and dented nuclear
submarine. With a CONCUSSION the sub EXPLODES.
175  EXT. HUDSON RIVER - SAME                                   175
An enormous SPRAY OF WATER erupts from the river,

180  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  180
Boxed in from either side, Godzilla RACES through the
water. At the same moment both submarines FIRE their
torpedoes.
Godzilla reaches the underwater shoreline of Manhattan
and begins BURROWING FURIOUSLY. As his gigantic claws
start DIGGING up earth, an enormous TURBULENCE of clouds
and dirt cloud the waters around him, cloaking him.
181  INT. ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT                                181

ocean floor, drifting down to the bottom of the Hudson
river like so many cement shoed gangsters.
188  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME - NIGHT                  188
Raymond and his men are laying out the plastic
explosives around the room by the clumps of eggs.
Jean-Claude walks up to Raymond.
JEAN-CLAUDE
We do not have enough explosives.
Raymond turns and sees Nick, across the room studying a
group of eggs. Raymond goes towards him.
ANGLE - AUDITORIUM FLOOR - HOLE - SAME
Crawling out from the hole in the center of the floor,
Animal and Audrey appear. They're stunned at what they
see. Quickly Animal hoists his camera and begins to film
as an amazed Audrey walks through.
ANGLE - NICK AND EGGS - MID-LEVEL DECK
Kneeling down along side the eggs, Nick examines them.
Raymond approaches.
RAYMOND
Nick, we have a problem.
Nick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to
listen to the egg. He leans his ear against the shell.
Suddenly we HEAR a loud CRACK. Nick jumps backwards.
The shell RUPTURES and an large FISSURE opens up across
the egg. As we hear other CRACKS O.S., Nick turns and
SEES more eggs beginning to open all around them.
ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL
Hidden in this forest of tall eggs, Animal leans in
close to one getting video footage of it cracking.
Audrey nervously watches. What she doesn't see, however,
is a BABYZILLA, fish hanging from its jaw, as it
approaches from behind.
ANGLE - NICK AND RAYMOND
Stunned, they can only stare as the BABYZILLA BREAKS
FREE of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous
WAIL.
RAYMOND
I think we should leave now.
NICK
Good idea.
The BABYZILLA kneels down and immediately starts
GOBBLING UP the dead fish laying nearby. Cautiously Nick
and Raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough
distance, they they break into a run and head for the
exit.
ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL
The Babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears
Audrey. Animal continues to shoot the cracking egg.
ANIMAL
(whispered)
One more second. This is fantastic.
Just then Animal turns to SEE the Babyzilla right behind
Audrey.
AUDREY
Don't you think we have enough?
ANIMAL
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Audrey turns to see what Animal is staring at. Her eyes
go WIDE as she backs up into Animal. Another BABYZILLA
appear on the other side of them.
ANIMAL
Just be calm. Don't startle them.
Animal leads Audrey backwards as they make their way
towards the large "team" entrance at the end of the
floor. The two Babyzillas swallow their fish and begin
to SNIFF the air.
Audrey moves up the isle. An egg CRACK
