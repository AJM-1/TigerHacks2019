DJANGO UNCHAINED

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY
As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.
The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).
One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.
As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
skin off ankles.
AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
Greenville Auction.
DJANGO
Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.
He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
unknown, never to be seen again.
As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;
DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
for forty.
WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
structure.
The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front
of the auction block.
2
DJANGO
is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
(their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
the block.
A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.
DJANGO
takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.
It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
buy Niggers, who look up to him.
His heart fills with poison.
BACK TO DJANGO
walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the
blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.
THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE
end.
/--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT
It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
their black skinned cargo forward.
It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and
all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
resemble a human locomotive.
The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
fur collars.
WHEN...
.A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
rifles for possible trouble.

A BLACK HORSE
carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the
foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.
THE RIDER
appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
hat on his head.
DICKY SPECK
Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
State your business, or prepare to get
winged!
THE RIDER
Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
face. He speaks with a slight German accent.
THE RIDER
(to the Slavers)
Good cold evening gentlemen.
(to the shivering Slaves)
Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
slave traders that go by the'name of
The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?
ACE SPECK
Who wants to. know?
THE RIDER
I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
is my horse, Fritz.
Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
him.
DICKY SPECK
You a doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Affirmative.
DICKY SPECK
What kinda doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?
ACE SPECK
So what?
LE
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, I wish to parley with you.
ACE SPECK
Speak English!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
second language. Amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe, is a specimen
I'm keen to acquire.
(to the slaves)
Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
you, who was formerly a resident of
The Carrucan Plantation?
Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
VOICE rings out;
DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid! And what's your name young, man?
DJANGO
Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
amazing name - during your time at the
Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
three overseers by the name of The Brittle
Brothers?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz is delighted.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?
DJANGO
Dem da Brittle Brothers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So Django, do you think you could recognize -
ï¿½. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.
ACE SPECK
Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like what?
ACE SPEC
Like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain
ACE SPECK
Speak English, goddamit!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.
ACE SPECK
I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
sale.
Ace raises his rifle towards the German.
ACE SPECK
Move it!
Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, did you simply get carried away
with your dramatic gesture, or are you
pointing that weapon at me with lethal
intention...?
ACE SPECK
Last chance, fancy pants
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Very well -
The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
darkness.
The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his
holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
.BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.
Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans
direction...
BAM...
Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
.The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we
hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
white man before.
Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
But I didn't want you to do anything rash
before you had a moment to come to your senses.
Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
Dicky's body.
DICKY SPECK
You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
Dr.SCHULTZ.
I only shot your brother, once he threatened
to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...
(COUNTING OUT
THE SLAVES)
.one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.
DICKY SPECK
My damn legs busted!
Dr.SCHULTZ
No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.
(TO DJANGO)
As I was saying, if you were to see
the Brittle Brothers again, would you
recognize them?
DJANGO
Yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
unshaven white men, can you honestly
and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?
DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.
BACK TO DJANGO
DJANGO
I can point 'em out.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
Django?
DICKY SPECK
I'm gonna lose this leg!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, unless you find a talented physician
very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
end result. But back to business, how much
do you want for Django?
DICKY SPECK
You go to hell!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be silly. How much for Django?
DICKY SPECK
800 dollars!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
the slave trade that you and your family does,
but neither was I born yesterday.

The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
that the going rate for African flesh'
- in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
why would they lie - puts his price at
eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
young Django here.
Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And since your late brother. won't be using
it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
Django is free.
Dr.SCHULTZ
There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
rubbing, then get up on that horse.
Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
bill of sale. Do you have one?
Dicky just curses him.
He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
(as he writes)
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
(he stops, then
says to Django)
Django is spelled with a silent "D",
is it not?
9
DJANGO
Huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not..
He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
way it looks.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that does add a little character.
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
mark here.
The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
He signs the bill of sale.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
pleasure doing business with you, but your
customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
leg irons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now as to you poor devils.
He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
to the nearest town. Which would be at least
thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
Or ...
.Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep, and make your way
to a more enlightened area of the country.
The choice is yours.
He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;
0
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, and on the off chance that there's
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Just give him a little kick.
Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, it's not so difficult.
EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, Django, what do you intend to name him?
DJANGO
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your horse?
DJANGO
What horse?
Dr.SCHULTZ'
The horse you're riding.
DJANGO
This ain't my horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is.
DJANGO
No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
it.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
technically not. If it's my horse, I can
give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
congratulations.
/1
DJANGO
I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
up in no stable.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(FRUSTRATED)
Don't worry about all that!
They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
then says with a smile;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
intend to name it? Half the fun of having
a horse is choosing his name. For instance
my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
couldn't do without him.
(he pats Fritz's neck)
Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
something one does lightly. So once you've
thought about it for awhile -
DJANGO
- Tony.
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Tony what?
DJANGO
- I dunno, Tony the horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
Tony?
DJANGO
Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
Why Tony?
DJANGO
I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
tell ya.
As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,
TEXAS"
/Z
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
well. Good job Django, well done.
EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
million other visitors.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's everybody staring at?
DJANGO
They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's this bizarre obsession they have
with. you not riding horses?
DJANGO
You askin' me?
Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So what other archaic rituals are you people
verboten to take part in?
As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
you can do, and what you can't do, and if
you can't do it, why can't you do it?
Like for instance, what if we were to walk
in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
order a drink, and drink it?
Would the authorities frown on that?
DJANGO
Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What part would they find the most offensive?
13
DJANGO
All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
with no white man, in public.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So if you and I did those things, that would
be considered enough of a infraction to make
the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?
DJANGO
You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case Django, after you.
DJANGO
Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django you're going to have to learn to trust
me, and as the man said; "There's no time
like the,present."
He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
establishment.
INT - SALOON - MORNING
The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the
saloon.
The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a
table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned
away from the two patrons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
weary travelers.
SALOON KEEPER
It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
for about a hour. But by then we'll be
servin' breakfast -
He turns around and sees them.
SALOON KEEPER
Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
get that nigger outta here.
IT
TIME CUT
EXT - SALOON - MORNING
It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
of the bar to get the Sheriff.
When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
and that would fall under the domain of the
Sheriff.
The Saloon Keeper runs away.
The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;
DJANGO
What kinda dentist are you?
This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
it's a disaster - But these days I practice
a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
This gets no
