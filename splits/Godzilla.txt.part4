nd, how can it be pregnant?
Excitedly Nick begins to pace.
NICK
The ultimate expression of evolution,
it reproduces asexually. Think about
it, all kinds of creatures have been
known to travel great distances for
reproduction. That's why he came to
New York. Like every species of
insufficient progenitors, he's
nesting!
AUDREY
Nesting?
NICK
Yes. Do you realize that a creature
like this could lay as many as a dozen
eggs at a time!
Nick moves to the front exit of the tent.
NICK
Forgive me but I've got to get this
into the lab, to confirm all this.
I'll be right back.
Nick rushes from the tent. Alone, Audrey can't help but
poke around a bit. She opens one of his CASES. Taped to
the roof of the case she SEES...
INSERT PHOTOS - NICK AND AUDREY
Happy times long ago. They're both young and in love.
Audrey is surprised Nick still keeps them. She's
touched.
Feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back
down. As she does she notices a video tape labeled
FIRST SIGHTING. Unable to resist, she puts it in and
turns on the t.v. The shot of the Japanese Cook
appears.
COOK
(filtered through t.v.)
...Gojira...Gojira...
She hits the fast forward tape and SEES, the enormous
footprints in Panama. She fast forwards again and sees
the beached cargo ship in Jamaica.
Audrey is torn. She makes a decision, pops the tape back
out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the
tent. Moments later, Nick returns from the front.
NICK
Audrey? Audrey?
A flash of lighting and thunder accents Nick's
confusion.
CUT TO:
110  INT. EDITING BAY - LATER - DAWN                            110
On two monitors we SEE Audrey doing a "stand up."
AUDREY
(filtered)
...which is why in this case "all the
kings horses and all the kings men"
may not be able to put the big apple
together again. Audrey Timmons, WNEW.
We pull back to reveal Audrey, Animal and an editor,
ED, watching the piece.
ED
That's it. You owe me a breakfast.
AUDREY
(turning to Animal)
So, what do you think?
ANIMAL
It's good. It's a real good piece. But
how'd you get a hold of this
material?
Audrey covers her own mixed emotions.
AUDREY
Like you said, "Good guys finish
last."
She snatches the tape and she takes off running.
Concerned and worried, Animal watches her leave.
CUT TO:
111  EXT. WNEW TRUCK - COMMAND TENT AREA - RAIN - DAWN          111
Rushing out of the WNEW truck and into the rain, Audrey
spots her Station Manager, Murray. In the b.g. we SEE
Caiman getting make up, about to do a live spot with
another cameraman.
AUDREY
Murray, I need you to look at this
tape.
MURRAY
Not now, Audrey, we've about to go
live with the morning report.
AUDREY
You're going to want to include this.
I've got exclusive footage of other
places this thing has attacked.
MURRAY
(suddenly interested)
You do? Who's story is this?
AUDREY
Mine!
ANGLE - CAIMAN
About to go on, Caiman waves off his make up artist as
he watches Audrey hand Murray the tape. His field
producer counts down to going live.
P.O.V. THROUGH BINOCULARS - NICK - RAIN - MORNING
Through the lenses we SEE exiting his tent and moving on
towards the large center command tent. We REVERSE to
reveal...
112  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - RAIN - MORNING          112
One of Raymond's men observes with binoculars from the
window. Tucking his napkin into his lapel, Raymond eats
breakfast with his men. Another man, JEAN-CLAUDE,
listens at the monitoring equipment. He turns to
Raymond.
JEAN-CLAUDE
Taisez-Vous.
He turns on the room speaker.
MALE VOICE

...Major Hicks, what makes you believe
another attempt to gun that creature
down will work?
113  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - RAIN - SAME - MORNING       113
Nick is moving to take his seat next to Elise at this
very crowded conference. The big wigs are here and the
room is packed. Major Hicks walks to a large map of
Manhattan.
MAJOR HICKS
General Anderson, the problem was the
terrain. If we lure him out into a
more open area such as this portion of
Central Park...
(points to the map)
We should be able to take him down.
MAYOR
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
MAJOR HICKS
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I
mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
All eyes turn towards Nick who's still arranging his
papers. Nervously Nick addresses the crowd.
NICK
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was
injured and bled.
MAJOR HICKS
You see, all we need to do is get a
better shot at it with weapons that
don't rely on heat seeking...
NICK
Um, excuse me, sir, but the
situation's more complicated than
that. The blood I recovered revealed
that the creature is either about to
lay eggs or already has.
GOVERNOR
Are you trying to tell us there's
another one of those things out
there?
NICK
I don't believe so.
MAYOR
Then how can it be pregnant? What is
this, the "virgin lizard?"
There's a smattering of laughter in the room.
NICK
No, it reproduces asexually. That's
why we must find the nest. If we
don't, dozens will be born, each one
capable of laying eggs of its own.
Very quickly we could be looking at an
enormous population.
MAJOR HICKS
So after we kill the creature we'll
begin a search for the nest.
NICK
It may be too late by then. These eggs
will hatch very quickly.
CLIVE
How could you possible know that?
NICK
The fish. The fish we found down in
the subway. He's not gathering all
that food for himself. He's preparing
to feed his young.
114  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - RAIN - SAME - MORNING               114
Raymond listens intently. He grabs a folder off the desk
and opens it. We SEE photos and documents of every
member of the team. He finds the photo of Nick and
examines it.
115  INT. DINER - RAIN - SAME - MORNING                         115
Audrey shakes off the rain and moves over to join Ed and
Animal at a booth.
ANIMAL
They just promo-ed your spot. It's
coming on right after this.
116  INT. COMMAND TENT - RAIN - SAME - MORNING                  116
An AIDE comes in and whispers something into the
Governor's ear, who nods approval.
MAJOR HICKS
If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must
act quickly before this problem
escalates.
GENERAL ANDERSON
You want to divide our efforts based
solely on a wild theory?
MAJOR HICKS
He's come through for us before and if
he feels strongly...
GENERAL ANDERSON
Come through for you!? Major, your
campaign's a disaster. You weren't
even able to to prevent this thing
from coming to Manhattan.
GOVERNOR
Excuse me Gentlemen, but I think we
should see this.
The Aide moves over to a television and turns it on.
Just as the t.v. comes to life we SEE the old Japanese
Cook.
GENERAL ANDERSON
How the hell did this get out?
The image of the Cook saying, "Gojira" FREEZES and cuts
back to reveal Caiman doing his "stand-up."
CAIMAN
(filtered)
From an old Japanese sailor's song
called GODZILLA, a mythological sea
dragon who attacked sailors, to our
own modern day terror. Today in my
special report, who is this Godzilla,
where did he come from and why is he
here?
117  EXT. DINER - SAME - MORNING                                117
Audrey is furious, on her feet.
AUDREY
You're special report! I'm the one
that found that stupid song! That's my
special report, you bastard!
Animal tries to calm her down as the story continues.
AUDREY
And it's "Gojira" not Godzilla you
moron!
118  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - SAME - MORNING                      118
Fiddling with the motel t.v., Raymond's men attempt to

Everyone stares at the television. Major Hicks burns
with embarrassment.
CAIMAN

...But why? Research team member Dr.
Niko Padopolus believes the creature
is nesting, using Manhattan as ground
zero to cultivate his species...
GENERAL ANDERSON
You went to the press with this?
NICK
No, I didn't...I didn't talk with
anyone.
The military men are furious at the breach of security.
All eyes turn toward Nick.
GENERAL ANDERSON
They mentioned you by name!
NICK
Yes...but I...
MAJOR HICKS
You gave them the tape?
NICK
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh
my God, she took it.
Pissed, GENERAL ANDERSON walks up to Nick.
GENERAL ANDERSON
Pack your stuff. You're officially off
this project as of now.
120  INT. DINER - SAME - MORNING                                120
Caiman is still on television, wrapping up.
AUDREY
He stole my report! That's my report!
ANIMAL
We know, Audrey.
CAIMAN

Audrey wads up her napkin and heaves it at the t.v.
AUDREY
Caiman you suck!
121  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MORNING                 121
The television is snapped OFF and Raymond walks over to
the window looking out, thinking. Finally...
RAYMOND
We're leaving.
CUT TO:
A LARGE TRUNK
Slams shut. More suitcases and trunks. Widen to
reveal...
122  INT. NICK'S TENT - LATER - DAY                             122
Nick is finishing packing as some soldiers carry his
things away. Elsie enters.
ELSIE
I'm sorry about all this.
NICK
Me too.
Nick hoists his bag and moves to leave.
NICK
Make sure they find that nest before
it's too late.
ELSIE
I'll try.
Reluctantly Nick nods acceptance and exits out into the
rain. We SEE the torn photographs of Nick and Audrey
laying on the floor.
ELSIE
Bye worm guy.
CUT TO:
123  INT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER - RAIN - DAY              123
Audrey in a street phone booth.
AUDREY
What do you mean Murray's not there? A
second ago you told me he was on the
other line...
Something catches Audrey's eye.
AUDREY'S P.O.V. - THROUGH GLASS - NICK
Lugging his bags out into the rain, Nick moves over to a
waiting cab.
124  EXT. COMMAND TENT AREA - NICK & CAB - RAIN - DAY           124
Lifting a heavy case, Nick places it into the cab's
trunk.
CABBY
Where to?
NICK
Newark airport.
Audrey moves up behind Nick.
AUDREY
You're leaving? Why?
Nick ignores her and continues to load the cab.
AUDREY
Is this cause of me? Because of the
story?
NICK
Well what the hell did you think was
going to happen?
AUDREY
You never said it was off the record.
NICK
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're
supposed to be my friend. I trusted
you.
AUDREY
I didn't mean for it to turn out like
this.
(confessing)
Look, I lied to you. I'm not a
reporter. When we broke up and I came
out to New York I was so sure I'd make
it. But I haven't. That's why I needed
this story so bad. I just couldn't
tell you I'm a failure.
NICK
So you thought that made it okay to
steal my tapes?
The last bag stowed, Nick moves to get into the cab. He
stops and turns back to her.
NICK
Good luck in your new career. I think
you really have what it takes.
He gets in and slams the door. The cab takes off leaving
a very alone Audrey standing in the rain.
AUDREY
(sad; to herself)
I'm sorry.

over.
WAITER
Can I get you something?
Before Nick can answer...
RAYMOND
Pernot, no ice.
Taking a seat directly across from Nick, Raymond sits
down, sizing him up. Nick is confused.
NICK
Do I know you?
RAYMOND
We've met before.
NICK
(remembering)
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
Raymond pulls out his badge and lays it on the table in
front of Nick.
RAYMOND
SDECE, Service de Documentation

Agent Phillip Raymond.
NICK
Sounds like a big company.
RAYMOND
It's the French Secret Service.
NICK
Oh.
RAYMOND
We have learned that your American
friends have decided not to look for
the creature's nest.
NICK
(alarmed)
Are you sure? How do you know?
RAYMOND
We know.
NICK
Why are you telling this to me?
RAYMOND
I need you to trust me.
NICK
Why do you need that?
RAYMOND
I need your trust if you're to help me
find the nest.
NICK
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
RAYMOND
We, have already taken care of them.
Nick realizes Raymond is serious. The waiter hands
Raymond his drink. Raymond toasts Nick.

Animal video tapes an interview with a displaced

DISPLACED PERSON
No one tells us a Goddamned thing. My
family is getting soaked out here. We

to go back to our home.
Animal begins to PAN his camera around the tent city
when he SEES a SEDAN in the distance. He focus in on it
and SEES...
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - SEDAN - NICK AND RAYMOND
Coming to stop at a light. Animal quickly lowers his
camera and hands it off to the Reporter he's working

ANIMAL

Animal rushes over to the news van and takes off after
them, following.
127  EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - AFTERNOON                 127
Pulling up in front of a warehouse, Nick and Raymond
step out of the sedan. Staying hidden from view, Animal
pulls over. Intrigued, he watches them enter the
building.
128  INT. WAREHOUSE - RAYMOND'S MEN - AFTERNOON                 128
Raymond enters with Nick. The room is filled with
equipment; radios, guns, explosives and armored
vehicles. We notice that more of Raymond's support team
are here.
NICK
How did you get all of this stuff into
the country?
RAYMOND
This is America. There is nothing you
can not buy.
Raymond gives Nick a tour.
NICK
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you
guys working with the US military?
RAYMOND
I am not permitted to speak of such
things.
Nick stops and confronts Raymond.
NICK
You said you wanted my trust, then I
need yours.
Raymond considers this. Finally...
RAYMOND
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can
you understand that?
NICK
Sure.
RAYMOND
It is my job to protect my country.
Sometimes I must even protect it from
itself. From mistakes we have made.
Mistakes that we do not want the world
to know about.
NICK
Your talking about the nuclear testing
in the Pacific.
RAYMOND
Yes. This testing done by my country
left a terrible mess. We are here to
clean it up.
129  EXT. WAREHOUSE - ANIMAL - SAME - RAIN - AFTERNOON          129
Moving down alongside the building, Animal walks down
the side alley. He climbs up onto a garbage hamper and
peers into a cracked opened window.
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - WAREHOUSE
Animal sees Nick and Raymond with all the hardware.
Several of the men are repainting the vehicles to
resemble those of the US Army.
130  INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME                                      130
Nick walks past the myriad of warfare tools. Jean-Claude
turns from the radios.
JEAN-CLAUDE
They will set the trap at thirty
minutes to ten.
RAYMOND
That is when we will go in.
Raymond leads Nick over to a large map.
RAYMOND
We know how to get into the city. We
just do not know where to start
looking.
Nick moves closer to the map, putting his finger on the
Flat Iron square subway station.
NICK
Here. 23rd street subway station.
Where we first found the fish. With a
little luck, this will lead us right
to it.
RAYMOND
So you're in?
NICK
Are you kidding? I always wanted to
join the French Foreign Legion.

132  INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON               132
Filled with people, Lucy is serving coffee. She smiles

ANIMAL
Who the hell are all these people?
LUCY
What? I just couldn't just let them
sleep in the street.
ANIMAL
Where's Audrey?
LUCY
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out
because of you.
ANIMAL
What?
LUCY
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff
you filled her head with.
ANIMAL
Me!? You where the one...
LUCY
Go in there. Talk to her.
Lucy pushes Animal towards the back bedroom.
133  INT. BEDROOM - SAME - LATE AFTERNOON                       133
Audrey has been crying. Crumpled Kleenex wads piled up

boasting the headline: THEY CALL HIM GODZILLA! On the
t.v. we SEE a news conference with General Anderson
addressing some reporters.
REPORTERS
(simultaneously)
Can you comment on the nest? How many
more of these things will there be?
GENERAL ANDERSON

That's why I'm holding this
conference. To try and avoid a
needless panic.
Animal enters and watches from the back of the room.
GENERAL ANDERSON
Contrary to some frivolous reports, we
have no information to lead us to
believe that there are any eggs of the
creature in the city.
AUDREY
Stupid idiots!
ANIMAL
You okay?
AUDREY
It's all my fault. What have I done,
Animal? What have I become? Look at
me. This isn't me. I don't do things
like this.
ANIMAL
You made a mistake.
Suddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of
the room. Animal looks at the stranger as he leaves.
AUDREY
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only
man who ever really cared about me.
ANIMAL
Didn't you tell me he left for the
airport?
AUDREY
Yeah. Why are you asking?
ANIMAL
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of
guys who want to sneak into the city
tonight.
Audrey tries to make sense of this. Suddenly she
realizes.
AUDREY
My God. He's going after the nest.
ANIMAL
Perfect! You wanted a story, well,
baby, you got one.
Excitedly Animal goes to the closet and retrieves a big
overcoat.
AUDREY
Animal, I can't.
ANIMAL
Look, you want to make it up to your
friend? Well if he's right, this is
your chance.
He starts going through his drawers, taking out battery
packs, tapes, etc, and putting it in his pockets.
AUDREY
(misgivings)
I don't know. I've already made such a
mess of things...
Animal walks up to the door, ready to exit.
ANIMAL
(smiling)
Audrey, I'm going after them. You can
come with me or not.
Conflicted, Audrey is not sure what to do. Animal opens
the bedroom window and begins to climb out.
AUDREY

of Raymond's men dressed similarly.
As they climb into their vehicles, Raymond hands each a
stick of chewing gum. Nick gets in the passenger seat of
one of the vehicles, Raymond climbs in behind the
wheel.
NICK
What's with the chewing gum?
RAYMOND
Makes us look more American.
Nick looks over at the faux Americans. It's a tough
sell, gum or not.
NICK
Just let me do all the talking.
With that the vehicles pull out of the warehouse and out

An armed blockage seals the Jersey entrance to the
Lincoln tunnel. We widen to reveal Audrey and Animal by

AUDREY

ANIMAL
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs

they repaired it last year I worked on
a piece about it.
Just then the lock TURNS and the door opens. They
enter.
