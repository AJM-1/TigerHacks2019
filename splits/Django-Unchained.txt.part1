 reaction from Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
The Black Man shakes his head, no.
As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,
HE EXPLAINS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well the way the slave trade deals in
human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
deals in corpses.
15
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
The state places a bounty on a man's head.
I track that man, I find that man, I kill
that man. After I've killed him, I transport
that man's corpse back to the authorities -
and sometimes that's easier said then done.
I show that corpse to the authorities -
proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
- At which point, the authorities pay me
the bounty.
(lifting his beer)
Cheers.
The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.
DJANGO
What's a bounty?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's like a reward.
DJANGO
You kill people and they give you a reward?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Certain people, yes.
DJANGO
White people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.
DJANGO
Bad people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Badder they are, bigger the reward.
Which brings me to you, and I must admit
I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
On the other hand, I need your help,
and if you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better. So for the time being,
I'm going to make this slave malarkey
work to my benefit.
(BEAT)
Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

ï¿½. DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis
Brittle, as Big John BURNS the "r" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON.
BACK TO DJANGO
DJANGO
I know what they look like, all right.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
with me till we find them -
DJANGO
- Where we goin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
That means we visit every plantation in
Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
find them, you point them out, and I kill
them. You do that, I agree to give you
your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
I've already gave him to you -- but once the
final Brittle brother lies dead in the
dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
included.
Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.
EXT - SALOON - MORNING
We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.
SHERIFF SHARP
Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
As they do, The Sheriff says;
1 2
SHERIFF SHARP
Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
start trouble, and scare all these nice
people? You ain't got nothin' better to
do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
and show your ass -
From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.
.THEN...
A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
dirt.
The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
As is Django.
As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;
PEDESTRIAN
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
skull, killing him dead.
In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now you can go get the marshall.
TIME CUT
EXT - DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET - DAY
U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention.
MARSHALL TATUM
Move that buckboard over there long ways
across the street from the saloon. And I
want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
And I want two men with two rifles on this
roof, and two men with two rifles on that
roof, with all barrels pointed at that
front door. And somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.
LP
Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the
building across the street from the saloon.
The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.
WHEN...
COMING FROM THE SALOON... . PIANO MUSIC ...
INT - SALOON - DAY
Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
on the window.
Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.
He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What are they doing?
DJANGO
I think they wonderin' why you playin'
the piana'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good.
(PAUSE)
But what are they doing?
DJANGO
A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
around out front, now they hidin' behind it
with guns. And a buncha other white folks
are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
down here.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
marshall out there?
DJANGO
If the one I think is the.marshall is the
marshall, he's out there.
)9
Dr.SCHULTZ
What makes you think he's the marshall?
DJANGO
Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.
MARSHALL'S VOICE
You in the saloon!
Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.
MARSHALL'S VOICE
We got eleven Winchesters on every way
outta that buildin'! You got once chance
git outta this alive! You and your nigger
come out right now with your hands over
your head, and I mean, right now!
Dr.SCHULTZ
First things first! Is this the marshall
I have the pleasure of addressing?
MARSHALL TATUM
Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
myself of all weapons, and just as you
have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
with my hands raised above my head.
I trust as a representative of the
criminal justice system of The United
States of America, I shant be shot down
in the street, by either you or your deputies,
before I've had my day in court.
MARSHALL TATUM
You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
'em down like a dog in the street!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
have your word as a lawman not to shoot
me down like a dog in the street?
MARSHALL TATUM
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
cheat the hangman in my town!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!
Dr.SCHULTZ
(TO DJANGO)
They're a little tense out there. So don't
make any quick movements, and let me do
the talking.
Django looks at him like, "as if..."
EXT - SALOON/MAIN STREET - DAY
A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised, step
outside.
MARSHALL TATUM
You unarmed?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
address you, your deputies, and apparently
the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
incident that just occurred?
MARSHALL TATUM
Go on!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
to elect as their sheriff, who went by
the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
with a price on his head of two hundred
dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
or alive.
MARSHALL TATUM
The hell you say!
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
news. But I'm willing to wager this man
was elected sheriff sometime in the last
two years. I know this because. three years
ago he was rustling cattle from,
The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
Lubbock Texas.
Z/
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
In my possession. is a warrant made out by
circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
He will back up who I am, and who your
dear departed sheriff was.
The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In other words marshall, you owe me
two hundred dollars.
CUT TO
EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
times. A man who survives, is a man with
a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
a good plan. So, having said that, what's
your plan, young Django?
DJANGO
What'cha mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, after this Brittle business is behind
us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
What's your plan after that?
DJANGO
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
Do most slaves take the institution of
matrimony seriously?
DJANGO
Huh?
ZZ
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do slaves believe in marriage'?
DJANGO
Me and my wife do.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where is she now?
DJANGO
I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
She got sold two days 'fore me.
But I don't know who to.
Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Care for some jerky?
DJANGO
Sure.
Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,
SCHULTZ SAYS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
where she is?
A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating
the dilemma, then pronounces;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
So how long ago did all this happen?
DJANGO
A few months ago.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Three or four?
DJANGO
Three.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation,
and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
monthsago?
Django nods his head, yes.
Z3
Dr.SCHULTZ
The bad part about slavery being a business,
is it's immoral. The good part about it being
a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
name in it, and the name of the customer who
bought her, and more then likely their address.
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
not going to get you very far in Greenville.
Not to mention a slave auction town in
Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
visit. Free or not.
DJANGO
I'll have my freedom papers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes you will. But say you show them to some
rascals, and they take them from you and
tear them up?
DJANGO
They could do that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not saying they would, but they could.
DJANGO
They do that I'll kill 'em.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
man. The point being is the place,is just
too dangerous for you.
DJANGO
Well I gotta go, when do I go?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you get more dangerous.
EXT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY
Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE that.
sells SERVANT/HOUSE NIGGER UNIFORMS. Django comes bursting out of the
stores back door. He's very distressed. One glance at the outfit he's
wearing explains the distress.
Z
DJANGO
is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that
wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at
Versailles.
Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
You're playing a character. Your character
is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
Remember what I told you. During the act,
you can never break character.
CUT TO
EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
wonder at this sight.
The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
at the darkee on the horse.
SPENCER BENNETT
It's against the law for niggers to ride
horses in this territory.
Dr.SCHULTZ
This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.
SPENCER BENNETT
I said niggers -
Z .ate`
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django, he's a free man, and
he can ride what he pleases.
SPENCER BENNETT
Not on my.property, around my niggers
he can't.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
valet, Django, and these are our horses,
Fritz, and Tony.
Fritz, does his head bow.
This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
are a gentleman, and a business man.
And it is in these capacities that we've
ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
with you now.
SPENCER BENNETT
State your business.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I wish to purchase one of your
nigger gals.
SPENCER BENNETT
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
no appointment, no nuttin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm afraid so.
SPENCER BENNETT
Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
say about that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
I've been led to believe you to be,
I have five thousand things I might say,
that could change your mind.
i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
Spencer laughs.
ZG
SPENCER BENNETT
C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool
to drink.
The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Maybe while we discuss business, you
could provide one of your loveliest black
creatures to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.
SPENCER
Absolutely. Betina!
A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
BETINA, snaps to attention.
BETINA
Yes sir, Big Daddy?
SPENCER
(TO SCHULTZ)
What's your Jimmies name again?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django.
SPENCER
Betina sugar, take Django around the
grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.
BETINA
As you please, Big Daddy.
Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
treated as an extension of myself.
SPENCER
Understood., Schultz. Betina?
BETINA
Yes, sir?
SPENCER
Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
him like any of these other niggers around
here, cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?
BETINA
Ya want I should treat 'em like white
folks?
SPENCER
No that's not what I said.
BETINA
Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.
SPENCER
Yes, I can see that.
(HE THINKS)
What's the name of that peckawood boy from
town works with the glass? His mama works
at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
the winda's when we have a problem?
The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;
MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
Oh, you mean Jerry.
SPENCER
Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.
(TO BETINA)
You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?
BETINA
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.
SPENCER
Well that's it then... just treat 'em
like you would Jerry.
EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.
BETINA
What'cha do for your massa'?
DJANGO
Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.
BETINA
So you really free?
DJANGO
Yes.
ZY
BETINA
You mean you wanna dress like that?
Django fumes.
EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
lemonade.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I've been'told by those who should know,
the most exquisite African flesh in the
state of Tennessee is bred right here on
your land. And from the look of these
black angels, my sources weren't wrong.
SPENCER
Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
field. But the lion share of my lady
niggers are real show pony's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
pony for young Django. So the only
question that remains is, do you have a
nigger here worth five thousand dollars?
SPENCER
Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
is practically my middle name.
BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.
DJANGO
Betina, come over here, I need to ask
you something.
He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.
BETINA
What'cho want?
DJANGO
I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
brothers. Overseers. Their name is
Brittle. Do you know 'em?
BETINA
Brittle?
DJANGO
Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.
BETINA
I don't know dem.
DJANGO
They could be usin' a different name.
They woulda' come to the plantation in
the last year.
BETINA
You mean The Shaffer's?
DJANGO
Maybe? Three brother?
BETINA
Ah-huh.
DJANGO
Are they here?
BETINA
Ah-huh.
DJANGO
Can you point one of 'em out to me?
BETINA
Well ones over in that field.
She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
field landscape.
SPYGLASS POV:
Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but
who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to Django's
observation.
DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a
BRANDING IRON.
BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS
