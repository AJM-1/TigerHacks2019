y in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
hands) come out to greet the caravan.
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
huge dust cloud behind it.
Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
ï¿½. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
the Big House to greet her brother.
Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out.
steps...
STEPHEN
eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
South. -
Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
(almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.
THEN...
Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
and for a moment don't know what to think.
Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
limp.
All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;
CALVIN CANDIE
Hello Stephen my boy!
STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
this nigger up on that nag?
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?
STEPHEN
Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
on that nag?
DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Snowball.
: Stephen looks up at Django on Tony.
DJANGO
If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
my horse, you ask me.
STEPHEN
Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.
CALVIN CANDIE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
funny. Django's a Freeman.
Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.
STEPHEN
This nigger, here?
CALVIN CANDIE
That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
the two of. you. Django, this is another
cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
Stephen, this is Django. You two should
hate each other.
Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the
blacks at Candyland.
STEPHEN
Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
feel the need to entertain?
CALVIN CANDIE
Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz
are customers, and they are our guests
Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
.are to show them every hospitality.
Do you understand that?
STEPHEN
I don't know why I gotta -
CALVIN CANDIE
You don't hafta know why, do you
understand?
STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.
CALVIN CANDIE
Good. They're spending the night. Go up
in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.
93
STEPHEN
(POINTING AT
DJANGO)
He's gonna stay in the Big House?
CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.
STEPHEN
(INCREDULOUS)
In the Big House?
CALVIN CANDIE
You gotta problem with that?
STEPHEN
I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
and the pillow cases once this black ass
motherfuckers gone!
CALVIN CANDIE
That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
Your problem, right now, is making a
good impression. And I want you to start
solving that problem right now, and git
them rooms ready.
The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;
STEPHEN
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up
to her brother on his horse.
CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle
is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
Django,
(Django tips his hat)
and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony.
Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And it is our great delight to encounter
this flaming rose.
LARA LEE
Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
You're not from around here, are you?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually I'm from a far off land,
Dusseldorf, to be exact.
CALVIN CANDIE
These two are in the market for a fightin'
nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
show 'em my stock.
LARA LEE
We'll all have dinner tonight, right?
CALVIN CANDIE
Half the reason I invited them. I thought
you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
little sister.
Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and
two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the
Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS
CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to
Dr.Schultz and Django, and says;
CALVIN CANDIE
You know since I started fightin' niggers
about eleven years ago, it's been a new
lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
now is the man responsible for all my
success.
Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and
Schultz.
CALVIN CANDIE
Howdy Ace.
(TO SCHULTZ
AND DJANGO)
This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
Ace Woody.
915
Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.
CALVIN CANDIE
And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
Cody.
(TO ACE)
Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
Django Freeman, they're big customers with
big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
brought 'em out here so you could give
'em a little display of our African flesh.
Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.
ACE WOODY
Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at
Django.
Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
Greenville to here.
ACE WOODY
These the new chickens?
CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob.
ACE WOODY
How many you get?
(HE COUNTS)
One, two, three, four, five.
CALVIN CANDIE
Five real strong bucks.
ACE WOODY
How many you get rid of?
CALVIN CANDIE
We still got three left.
Ace looks to see who came back from the auction.
Leo Moguy chimes in;
MOGUY
I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people,
they'll be here tomorrow.
Ace turns to Brown.
ACE WOODY
Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in
the pen till tomorrow.
Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into
the slave pen.
Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big
Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua.
ACE WOODY
Y'all stand over there and make a line!
They do.
Ace climbs down from off his horse.
Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;
CALVIN CANDIE
What do you think?
ACE WOODY
I think you lookin' for niggers to push
a plow, 'dem your boys.
Candie rolls his eyes.
CALVIN CANDIE
What's wrong with them?
ACE WOODY
Hold it...hold it, you done bought
r em, let me look at 'em.
Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.
ACE WOODY
Okay, how 'bout that one, did you
buy that one?
CALVIN CANDIE
Which one?
ACE WOODY
What you mean, which one? The one I'm
pointing at, that one.
77
CALVIN CANDIE
Actually, that one was purchased by
our mister Moguy.
ACE WOODY
(TO MOGUY)
You bought him?
MOGUY
Yes I did.
ACE WOODY
Why?
MOGUY
I like his prospects.
ACE WOODY
His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy,
I ain't a educated fella like yourself.
Remind me again what prospects means?
MOGUY
Hope for the future.
Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.
ACE WOODY
You got hope for his future?
MOGUY
I did.
ACE WOODY
Well I don't.
Ace walks over to the slave in question.
ACE WOODY
What's your name, boy?
The mandingo says;
SIDNEY JAMES
Sidney James, sir.
ACE WOODY
So long Sidney James.
Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS
Sidney James point blank in the belly.
Everybody reacts.
Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery.
Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
Ace looks up at his boss.
ACE WOODY
Boss Candie, which one did you buy?
CALVIN CANDIE
Well to me the pick of the litter is
Big Fred over there.
ACE WOODY
(POINTING AT
FRED)
This one over here?
CALVIN CANDIE
Yes.
ACE WOODY
(TO FRED)
You Fred?
A very scared Fred answers.
BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
ACE WOODY
Well good to meet'cha Fred, I'm'Ace Woody,
I'm a man of influence 'round here. Now
Fred am I mistaken, or were you already in
a kurfuffle?
CALVIN CANDIE
I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers
last night.
'ACE WOODY
How is of Amerigo?
CALVIN CANDIE
His nigger lost.
99
ACE WOODY
(TO FRED)
Really? You won?
BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
ACE WOODY
Wup'ed his ass?
CALVIN CANDIE
Beat 'em to death.
Smiling impressively at Big Fred.
ACE WOODY
(TO FRED)
Really?
CALVIN CANDIE
He did have fifteen pounds on 'em,
but still, he still beat his ass
to death.
ACE WOODY
(TO FRED)
You did?
BIG FRED)
Yes, sir.
ACE WOODY
Good job, boy. Got any more wins in ya?
BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
Candie acts out mock frustration.
The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.
CALVIN CANDIE
Now why did you do that?
ACE WOODY
He won his last fight last night.
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos
1 00
ACE WOODY
(TO MANDINGOS)
Those of you with exceptional ability
will find it ain't so bad here. Those of
you who don't possess exceptional ability,
will wish you did.
Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.
ACE WOODY
Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin
push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em
in the head.
(TO MANDINGOS)
Welcome to Candyland, boys!
Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
Candie leans over to Schultz and says;
CALVIN CANDLE
We only get about two out of every batch
of five fighters we buy. But those two
tend to be lucky.
Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.
CALVIN CANDIE
You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
that you don't trust my judgement?
Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;
ACE WOODY
Oh you know I always trust your judgement,
Boss Candie...eventually.
He rides off.
Stephen limps back to the action.
CALVIN CANDIE
Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?
STEPHEN
All ready for your guest and his nigger.
Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration.
CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're incorrigible.
(TO SCHULTZ
AND DJANGO)
Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your
rooms.
/O+
CALVIN CANDLE
(CON'T)
There you can lie down and rest up
for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
my finer specimens.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named TIMMY.
CALVIN CANDIE
Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
of oats.
Django hands the boy the reigns.
DJANGO
That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
care of 'em now.
TIMMY
Yes, sir.
Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.
DJANGO
Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.
DJANGO
Give that one to Fritz.
Timmy leads the horses away.
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
Dr.Schultz pretends to remember something;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
the nigger girl we were talking about?
CALVIN CANDIE
Nigger girl?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I believe you said she spoke German?
CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?
,oz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you think before the demonstration you
could send her around to my room?
CALVIN CANDIE
I don't see why not.
(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.
STEPHEN
Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
somethin' we ain't tole you yet.
CALVIN CANDIE
What?
STEPHEN
Hildi's in The Hot Box.
This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.
CALVIN CANDIE
What's she doin' there?
STEPHEN
What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
she bein punished.
CALVIN CANDIE
What she do?
STEPHEN
She ran away again.
CALVIN CANDIE
Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
when I was gone?
STEPHEN
Two.
CALVIN CANDIE
When did she go?
STEPHEN
Last night. They brought her back this
morning.
CALVIN CANDLE
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
motherfuckers right now.
STEPHEN
Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
lookin' for her and found her. She a little
beat up, but she did that to herself.
Runnin' through them damn bushes.
Django's hand moves away from his gun.
CALVIN CANDIE
How long she been in the box?
STEPHEN
What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
fool got ten more days to go.
CALVIN CANDLE
Take her out.
STEPHEN
(INCREDULOUS)
Take her out? Why!
CALVIN CANDLE
Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
hospitality dictates I make her available
to him.
STEPHEN
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?
CALVIN CANDLE
Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
her out.
(to Cora and
LARA LEE)
Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible
for getting her cleaned up and presentable
for Dr.Schultz?
The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.Box. While
Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.
Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's
sizzling in it.
The HOT BOX
itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and the two
men lift the heavy iron door open.
REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box
dug into the ground.
Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine.
WHEN ...
Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
Django watches this.
DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED
BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.
REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS
as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE.
Stephen breaks the mood.
STEPHEN
(TO DJANGO)
You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
little box?
Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and
Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.
INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY
Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in
the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest
rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters
the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the
room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.
INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a
lamp and a tiny bell on it.
105
STEPHEN
This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
nice too.
Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out.
Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen
rattles on in the background.
STEPHEN
Feel free to touch anything you want,
cause we burnin' all this shit once you
gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
door when the demonstration ready.
Django sits down on the bed.
Stephen turns to leave.
DJANGO
Not so fast.
STEPHEN
I got more important things to do then
jaw with you.
DJANGO
Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots.
Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.
DJANGO
This tiny bell on this little table...
.is this for you? I ring this, you
do fer me?
STEPHEN
Me or somebody.
Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
(a soft) DING-A-LING
STEPHEN
(UNAMUSED)
What 'cha want?
DJANGO
I want you to pour some water in that
bowl for my wash up.
Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.
)O'
Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.
DJANGO
Gimmie.
Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
Django takes it from him.
Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.
DJANGO
Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like
that?
Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
knocking him to the floor;
DJANGO
That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the
floor below his knees.
DJANGO
I've known me House Niggers like you my
whole life. Play your dog tricks with your
Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an'
then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He
rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and
all the white folks think it's so cute.
Meanwhile you got all these niggas round
here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your
good side. Well this time Snowball, you
gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass
you wanna sling my way, before they give
us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna
give this whole motherfuckin plantation
a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK
off your ass. I will make you drop your
drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will
Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of
every nigga on this plantation. And after
I do that, let's see you play the rooster
round here.
X07
STEPHEN
Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.
DJANGO
Oh that's right, he gives you first name
privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me
me again nigger, see what happen'.
Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.
DJANGO
That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
Before he leaves, Django tells him;,
DJANGO
When I ring this bell, you better come
a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While
I'm on this property, you my nigger
Snowball.
Stephen leaves.
Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm.
A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and
Schultz stands there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Was that wise?
Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.
DJANGO
He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
That's all that needs to be said.
INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY
Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a
domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door,
after Calvin's sister raps on it.
Dr.Schultz opens the door.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Hello ladies.
DOG
LARA LEE
Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
speaks German.
Dr.SCHULTZ
(TO BROOMHILDA)
I've been informed you do as well.
BROOMHILDA
(GERMAN)
It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
in German.
Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Astonishing.
(IN GERMAN)
Please come insid
