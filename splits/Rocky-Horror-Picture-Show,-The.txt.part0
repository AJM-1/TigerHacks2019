15	EXT.	A STILL FRAME OF A DENTON CATHOLIC CHURCH	DAY
CHORUS (Cont)
To the late night double feature
Picture Show.
The SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the IMAGE EXPANDS TO
WIDE-SCREEN.  The STILL FRAME bursts to life as the doors of the Denton
Catholic Church are flung open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds
from the church organ.
The young married couple, RALPH and BETTY HAPSCHATT appear followed by a
crowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting
excitedly.
The MINISTER shakes RALPH by the hand while RALPH slips him a $20 bill.
PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures.
BRAD MAJORS, a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his mid-
twenties, comes over the congratulate RALPH.  BRAD and RALPH shake
hands.
RALPH
Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!
BRAD
Well I don't think there was any doubt
about that - You and Betty have been
almost inseparable ever since you sat
in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.
RALPH
Tell you the truth Brad, she was the
only reason I came in the first place.
Science was never one of my favourite
subjects but I sure with Dr Scott
could have made it today.
BRAD
Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him.
We drove over to see him last vacation.
It's a shame his new job took him away
from Denton.
BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet.
JANET catches it.  She squeals with delight.
The GUESTS cheer.
RALPH
Hey fella.  It looks like it could be
your turn next.
BRAD
Who knows...ha ha.
RALPH & BETTY drive off.  GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD & JANET with great
enthusiasm.  GUESTS begin to disperse.
JANET & BRAD linger outside the church.  So do a strange FAMILY :  An
old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter.  They resemble the
Quaker family in "American Gothic", a painting.
The MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church
doors.  Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside.  The FAMILY, and the
MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we
shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place.
JANET (who is holding the bouquet)
Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't
Betty look radiantly beautiful.
Just an hour ago she was plain old
Betty Monroe.  Now she's Mrs.
Ralph Hapschatt.
BRAD (Still looking after the car)
Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a
lucky guy.  (They start to move d.s.)
JANET
Yes.
BRAD
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful
little cook.
JANET
Yes.
BRAD
And Ralph himself will be in line for
promotion in a year or so.
JANET
Yes.
FIRST CHORD OF "WEDDING SONG"
16	EXT.	CHURCH	DAY
"WEDDING SONG" (Silent playback for dialogue)
With great decision BRAD turns on JANET
BRAD (spoken)
Hey Janet.
JANET
Yes Brad.
BRAD
I've got something to say.
JANET
Uh huh.
BRAD
I really loved the skilful way
You beat the other girls
To the bride's bouquet.
JANET
Oh Brad.

BRAD
The river was deep but I swam it.

BRAD
The future is ours so let's plan it.

The road was long but I ran it.
(He runs backwards towards church doors)
FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
Janet.
BRAD (Climbing onto fence)
There's a fire in my heart
And you fan it.  (Jumps off)
FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
Janet.
BRAD
If there's one fool for you
Then I am it.
FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
Janet.
BRAD (Getting chalk from pocket)
I've one thing to say and that's,
Dammit, Janet.
He chalks a heart and arrow on the church door, which Riff Raff proceeds
to wipe off.
BRAD
I love you.
JANET runs to him, he kneels and produces a ring.
BRAD
Here's a ring to prove that
I'm not joker.
CHURCH BELLS Peal out.  RIFF & MAGENTA open doors and solemnly enter the
church, door closes behind them.
BRAD
There's three ways that love can grow.
That's good bad or mediocre.
JANET grabs the ring as BRAD rises.  She throws down the bouquet and
would fall into BRAD's arms but he goes to the door to chalk on it
again.
BRAD
Oh - J - A - N - E - T
I love you so.
JANET, transfixed, bursts into the church.
17	INT. CHURCH		DAY
"WEDDING SONG"  Pt. 2
JANET bursts into the church, hypnotised by the ring.  BRAD follows her.
JANET
Oh!......It's nicer than
Betty Munroe had
MAGENTA (Peering up from behind pew)
Oh Brad.
JANET
Now we're engaged and I'm so glad.
MAGENTA & COLUMBIA
Oh Brad.  (Both peer up and disappear)
JANET
That you met Mom
And you know Dad.
WHOLE FAMILY
Oh Brad.  (peering up together)
JANET (Taking his arm)
I've one thing to say
And that's, Brad
I'm mad,
For you too.
BRAD & JANET start to walk d.s., arm in arm.
the strange FAMILY march slowly across them l/r., in front.
JANET (Laying head on Brad's sh.)
Oh, Brad.
BRAD
Oh Dammit.
JANET (Caresses his cheek)
I'm mad.....
BRAD
Oh Janet
JANET
For you.
BRAD (briefly kisses her)
I love you too-oo-oo.
BRAD takes JANET's hands, turning to her.  We are aware of THE FAMILY
bringing in coffin in b.g. through vestry door.
BRAD & JANET
There's one thing left to do-ah-ooh
(They separate)
BRAD
And that's go see the man
Who began it
FAMILY (Carrying coffin)
Janet.
BRAD
When we met in his science exam

Janet
FAMILY lower coffin onto floor.
BRAD
I've got one thing to say, and that's
Dammit,
Janet.
I love you.
JANET runs to BRAD and he hugs her.
BRAD (Circling Janet)
Dammit, Janet.
JANET circles BRAD twice, admiring her ring on the way.
JANET
Oh Brad,
I'm mad.
BRAD
Dammit, Janet.
BRAD & JANET kneel together with each following word until they are
kneeling on the floor)
BRAD, JANET, FAMILY.
I love you.
BRAD & JANET kiss.
The cross above spits optically.
18	INT.	A STUDY	NIGHT
Mahogany bookcases, a large desk with a prominent globe of the world.  A
well-padded armchair has its back to the camera.  It swings around
revealing the NARRATOR.  He is in his smoking jacket.  He speaks
directly to us.
NARRATOR
I would like if I may to take you on a
strange journey.
He crosses to the bookshelf.  He selects a dossier.  We see the title:
"The Denton Affair".  He returns to his desk and places it on a
bookstand.  He puts on his reading glasses.
NARRATOR
It seemed a fairly ordinary night when
Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss
(two young ordinary healthy kids) left
Denton that late November evening to
visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and
now friend of both of them.  It's true
there were dark storm clouds, heavy,
black and pendulous, toward which they
were driving.  It's true also that the
spare tyre they were carrying was badly
in need of some air.  But they being
normal kids and on a night out, well
they were not going to let a storm
spoil the events of their evening.
On a night out.
He closes the book marking the place.
Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track.
NARRATOR
It was a night out they were going to
remember for a very long time.
Lighting cracks on the sound track.
WIPE TO
19	EXT.	NIGHT
A windscreen wiper working under strain.  Torrential rain on the
windscreen.  BRAD concentrating on visibility.  JANET eating chocolates
and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The
Shadow.
A motorcycle roars past them.
JANET
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist
that's passed us.  They certainly take
their lives in their hands.  What with
the weather and all.
BRAD
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to
that type.
JANET takes another stick of gum.
Offers BRAD some.  He declines.
The car slows to a halt.
JANET
What's the matter Brad, darling?
Headlights on sign reading: "DEAD END".
BRAD
I think we took the wrong fork a few
miles back.
JANET
Oh dear!  But then where did the
motorcyclists come from?
BRAD
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have
to turn back.
CUT TO
20	EXT.	ROAD	NIGHT
Car reverses.
BRAD puts his foot on the accelerator.  The wheel skids and explodes.
CUT TO
21	INT.	CAR	NIGHT
JANET
What was that bang?
BRAD
We must have a blow-out.
JANET
Oh...
Pause
CUT TO
22	EXT.	ROAD	NIGHT
A bolt of lighting strikes a tree.
CUT TO
23	INT.	CAR	NIGHT
BRAD
You'd better sit here and keep warm
while I go for help.
JANET
But where will you go?  We're in the
middle of nowhere.
BRAD
Didn't we pass a castle back down the
road a few miles?  Maybe they have
a telephone I might use.
He unbuckles his seatbelt.
JANET
I'm coming with you.
BRAD
There's no point both of us getting wet.
JANET
I'm coming with you.
(she unbuckles her seatbelt)
Besides, darling, the owner of the phone
might be a beautiful woman and you may
never come back.
BRAD laughs.
A thunderclap.
MUSIC commences and she alights from the car and follows him, newspaper
over her head.
CUT TO
24	EXT.	ROAD	NIGHT
SONG:		"OVER AT THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE"
The rain pours off the newspaper down JANET's face.  She walks along,
catching up with BRAD.
She sing plaintively.
JANET
In the velvet darkness
Of the blackest night
Burning bright.
We see the two of them - BRAD striding ahead, JANET nearly catching up
with him.
Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations.
JANET
There's a guiding star
No matter what or who you are.
They have passed a row of trees.  A rock formation in the shape of a
castle is silhouetted against the sky.  It has a flag flying from the
turret.
Lightning strikes.
A glow of light appears in a window.  It illuminates a path to the
castle.
BRAD and JANET turn.
The castle is in the distance between the two of them.
BRAD & JANET
There's a light
The castle looms in the distance.
PHANTOM VOICES
Over at the Frankenstein place.
BRAD stares hard.
BRAD
There's a light.
The castle looms closer.
PHANTOM VOICES
Burning in the fireplace.
JANET
(looks to Brad)
There's a light, a light
In the darkness of everybody's life
Taking JANET by the hand, BRAD moves off the roadway towards the house.
BRAD
I can see the flag fly
I can see the rain
Just the same
There has got to be
Something better here
For you and me.
Lighting strikes.
JANET jumps towards BRAD.
BRAD & JANET
There's a light.
The castle seems to move forward.
PHANTOM VOICES
Burning in the fireplace.
BRAD
There's a light.
CUT TO
25	EXT.	CASTLE DRIVEWAY	NIGHT
A motorcycle convoy roars by revealing a hidden road to the castle.
BRAD
A light
In the darkness of everybody's life.
The convoy drives up and disappears into a secret entrance in the rock.
CUT TO
26	EXT.	CASTLE FACADE	NIGHT
We see a cell-like window near a massive lighted window.  A tortured
face appears squinting into the darkness.
RIFF RAFF
The darkness must go
Down the river of nights dreaming
Flow morphia slow
Let the sun and light come streaming
Into my life.
CUT TO
27	EXT.	SKY	NIGHT
Lightning strikes.
CUT TO
28	CASTLE FACADE	NIGHT
RIFF RAFF moves to the lighted window where his hunchbacked shape
becomes a giant shadow.
RIFF RAFF
Into my life.

BRAD and JANET start moving down the driveway.
BRAD & JANET
There's a light.

Shadow turns in the window.
PHANTOM VOICES
Over at the Frankenstein place.

BRAD & JANET
There's a light.
CUT TO
32	CASTLE FACADE	NIGHT
The shadow slowly covers the whole window.
PHANTOM VOICES
Burning in the fireplace.
CUT TO
33	EXT.	CASTLE DRIVE	NIGHT
PHANTOM VOICES
There's a light, a light.
BRAD and JANET are at the gate.  There is a rusted sign.
BRAD & JANET
In the darkness of everybody's life.
A bolt of lighting illuminates the sign which reads:  FRANK N. FURTER -
SCIENTIST.
WIPE TO
34	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT
The NARRATOR is in his armchair.  He leans forward with some urgency.
NARRATOR
And so it seemed that fortune had smiled
on Brad and Janet and that they had found
the assistance that their plight required -
or had they?
Thunderclap.
WIPE TO
35	EXT.	FRONT DOOR OF THE CASTLE	NIGHT
BRAD rings the doorbell.  It makes a strange sound.
JANET
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold
and I'm frightened.
BRAD
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have
a telephone.
The door opens.  Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there
is a party going on in the distance.
The figure we have seen at the window emerges.  He is a hunch-backed
servant, RIFF RAFF.
RIFF RAFF
Hello.
BRAD
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors.
And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I -
ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our
car has broken down about two miles up the
road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
RIFF RAFF
You're wet.
JANET
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
BRAD
Yes.
RIFF RAFF
Yes.
36	EXT.	CASTLE	NIGHT
A bolt of lighting illuminates a row of vehicles parked by the castle.
37	EXT.	FRONT DOOR OF CASTLE	NIGHT
BRAD sees them and reacts with surprise.
RIFF RAFF realises BRAD has seen them.
RIFF RAFF
I think you had better both come inside.
JANET
You're too kind.
They enter apprehensively.
DISSOLVE
38	INT.	STAIRWAY	NIGHT
RIFF RAFF leads them down a stairway and beckons them to follow.
The MUSIC has become louder.
JANET
(sotto voce)
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind
of place is this?
BRAD
(sotto voce)
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting
lodge for rich weirdos.
CUT TO
39	INT.	HALLWAY	NIGHT
They arrive at a hallway at the bottom of the stairs.  Another servant,
MAGENTA, who bears a striking physical resemblance to RIFF RAFF is
vacuuming the stairs.
RIFF RAFF
This way.
JANET steps over the vacuum lead.
JANET
Are you - giving a party?
RIFF RAFF
No.  You've arrived on a rather special
night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
JANET
Oh, lucky him.
MAGENTA
He's lucky.
BRAD and JANET look at MAGENTA, surprised by her voice.
MAGENTA
You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all
lucky.
40	SONG:		"THE TIME WARP"
BRAD and JANET are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic.
They look back to RIFF RAFF.  He is now standing by a set of mirrors
reflecting to infinity.
RIFF RAFF
It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely
Not for very much longer
I've got to keep control.
MAGENTA gives RIFF RAFF a strange signal.
RIFF RAFF starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion.
RIFF RAFF
I remember doing the Time Warp.
BRAD and JANET are amazed.
RIFF RAFF
Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me.
MAGENTA half closes her eyes in pleasure.
JANET clings to BRAD.
RIFF RAFF
And the void would be calling.
RIFF RAFF opens a set of double doors marked BALLROOM.
41	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT
BRAD and JANET find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver
ballroom.  At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding
it, a theatre proscenium.  In the body of the room are GUESTS.  They are
the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road.  They are the
Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from
all over the earth.  It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention -
announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom.  They are
all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear.  They are a distorted
version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding.  A party spirit prevails,
they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.
GUESTS
Let's do the Time Warp again.
JANET falls into BRAD's arms.
RIFF RAFF is ecstatic.
BRAD revives JANET.
GUESTS
(repeating action)
Let's do the Time Warp again.
JANET faints again.
CUT TO
42	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT
The NARRATOR moves from his desk to the wall behind him.  He pulls down
a chart with illustrated dance steps on it.  He gestures to the
appropriate section of the diagram with the pointer.
NARRATOR
It's just a jump to the left.
WIPE TO
43	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT
The GUESTS leap to the left in one giant step.
GUESTS
(dancing)
And a step to the right - right -
right - right - right.
WIPE TO
44	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT
NARRATOR points to next step on the chart.
NARRATOR
With your hands on your hips.
WIPE TO
45	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT
ALL GUESTS have hands on hips.
GUESTS
You bring your knees in tight.
But it's the pelvic thrust.
The rows of GUESTS open out with pelvic thrusts.
GUESTS (Cont)
They really drive you insane.
We see them from the balcony and they open out in formation.
GUESTS (Cont)
Let's do the Time Warp again.
JANET revives.
The GUESTS re-form.
GUESTS
Let's do the Time Warp again.
BRAD and JANET make a run out the door.
CUT TO
46	INT.	STAIRWAY	NIGHT
They collide with MAGENTA who has blocked off the corridor with her
vacuum.  She sings with menace, waving the cleaner hose dangerously.
MAGENTA
It's so dreamy
Oh, fantasy free me
So you can't see me
No not at all.
BRAD and JANET look at each other in alarm.
In another dimension.
(she forces them back towards
balcony)
With voyeuristic intention.
BRAD blushes.
Well secluded I see all
With a bit of a mind flip
You're into the time slip
Nothing will ever seem the same.
They are back at the balcony.
You're spaced out on sensation.
They are at the edge of the balcony.
Like you're under sedation.
They force BRAD and JANET into the Ballroom proper.
The GUESTS turn on them.
GUESTS
Let's do the Time Warp again.
BRAD and JANET are completely dismayed.
GUESTS
Let's do the Time Warp again.
COLUMBIA, a young girl, is the household groupie.  She sings with the
band at the end of the Ballroom.
CUT TO
47	INT.	BANDSTAND	NIGHT
COLUMBIA
Well I was wa
