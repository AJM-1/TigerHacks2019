I'm not sure we'll be able to take
the field against your team if that
boy is in uniform.
RICKEY
Herbert, what your team does is
your decision. But my team is
coming to Philadelphia. With
Robinson. If we have to claim the
game as a forfeit, we will. That's
9-0 in case you forgot.
PINK REV 4-19-12 95A.
PENNOCK
Branch, you've got one helluva hair
across your ass on this thing and
I, for one, would like to know what
you're trying to prove?
RICKEY
Do you think God likes baseball? I
do.
PENNOCK
What the hell does that mean?
RICKEY
It means you're going to meet God
one day, Herb, and when he inquires
why Robinson wasn't on the field in
Philadelphia and you answer because
he was a Negro, it may not be a
sufficient reply.
As Rickey hangs up the phone...

No one is listening as the TEAM DRIVER opens the lower

HOTEL MANAGER
Out! Get that bus out of here!
The HOTEL MANAGER stalks over, flanked by HOTEL SECURITY.
PARROTT
We're the Dodgers. We have a
reservation.
HOTEL MANAGER
Your team's not welcome, not while
you have ballclub Negroes with you.
PARROTT
You mean Robinson can't stay here?
HOTEL MANAGER
I mean the entire team is refused!
PARROTT
We've been staying here ten years.

Jack is embarrassed, but what can he do? Walker says to no

WALKER
Maybe 42's got enough friends in
town, we can bunk up.
JACK
What's that supposed to mean?
WALKER
Nothing. It's just, I know when
you can't get into a hotel, you got
people's houses you can stay at.
JACK
What do you want from me, Walker?
WALKER
An apology.
JACK
(STEPS FORWARD)
For what? Places like this?
Parrott alarmed at this turn of events.
WALKER
For turning this season into a

So am I! I'm here to win!

Jack pretends to sniff the air around Parrott.
JACK
You been drinking, Harold?
PARROTT
Mr. Rickey thinks it's a good idea.
He says it'll be in every sports

that'll show everyone even the most

JACK
Chapman hasn't changed. He's just
trying to take the heat off.
PARROTT
Mr. Rickey says it doesn't matter
if he's changed. As long as it

said he'd come down here. Or meet

We'll hold the bat. That way we

Chapman nods, looks relieved. A photographer hands over a

RICKEY
What can I do for you, Pee Wee?
REESE
Well, Mr. Rickey, it's like this,
the series in Cincinnati next week.
RICKEY
It's an important road trip, we're
only three games out of first.
REESE
Yes, sir. You know, I'm from
Kentucky.
RICKEY
Cincinnati's nearly a home game for
you.
REESE
I got this letter, sir. I guess
some people aren't too happy about
me playing with Robinson.
Rickey is not liking where this is going; he motions for the
letter, scans it, reads the highlights...
RICKEY
Nigger lover. Watch yourself. We
will get you, carpetbagger.
(holds it out)
Typical stuff.
Reese takes the letter back, a little hurt.
REESE
It's not typical to me.
RICKEY
How many of these letters have you
gotten, Pee Wee?
REESE
Just this. Ain't that enough?
Rickey looks Reese over a moment. Pushing back his chair he
steps over to a filing cabinet.
WHITE 3-14-12 101.
Motioning Reese to join him, he pulls open a drawer, pulls
out a 4-inch stack of flattened letters, then another, then a
third. He looks to Reese.
REESE (CONT'D)
What are those?
RICKEY
I'll tell you what they aren't,
they aren't letters from the Jackie
Robinson fan club. Here --
He thrusts a sheaf of it into Reese's hands. As Reese flips
through the stack of hate, reads:
REESE
Get out of baseball, or your baby
boy will die.
(NEXT ONE)
Quit baseball or your Nigger wife
will be...
Reese trails off, won't say it out loud. Skips to another.
REESE (CONT'D)
Get out of the game or be killed.
He looks at one more, reacts to the vitriol, but does not
utter it. Reese looks back at Rickey, shocked.
REESE (CONT'D)
Does Jackie know?
RICKEY
Of course he knows. And the FBI.
They're taking a threat in
Cincinnati pretty seriously. So
excuse me if I'm not too shocked at
you being called a carpetbagger.
You should be proud of it!
REESE
We'd just like to play ball, Mr.
Rickey. That's all we want to do.
RICKEY
I understand. I bet Jackie just
wants to play ball. I bet he wishes
he wasn't leading the league in hit
by pitch. I bet he wishes people
didn't want to kill him. But the
world isn't so simple anymore. I'm
not sure it ever was. We just,
baseball ignored it. Now we can't.

Slaughter swings, hits a hard ground ball right at Reese who
fires over to Jack at first. Slaughter is out by fifteen
feet, but he never slows down. And his foot comes down --
-- High on Jack's right calf. Slaughter's spiked him
something wicked. Jack goes down in a heap clutching his
leg, blood already seeping through his high socks.
Slaughter, head down, on his way to the visitor's dugout as
Dodger players pour out of their own to protest. As the UMP

Rickey starts slowly rubbing the baseball in his hands.
RICKEY
A fine young man. I saw him laid
low. Broken because of the color
of his skin and I didn't do enough
