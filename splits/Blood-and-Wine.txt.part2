GABRIELLA (Copt' d )
Now I have to go stay at my cousin's
place -- my cousin, her husband,
their four kids, and two cats. I
hate cats.
JASON
What's wrong with cats?
GABRIELLA
They shed on the couch I'll have to
sleep on. You know how long it took
me to find that job? Everybody
thinks they're running for office.
You don't have papers, they don't
even want to meet you. And the only
real way to get legal is to get
married. Do you understand?
He opens her car door for her.
JASON
So let's go get married.
Gabriella looks at him. They connect.again; it scares
her.
GABRIELLA
... Are you old enough to vote?
She slides behind the wheel.
JASON
(TARTLY)
You're not too much older. Are you
going past the wharf? You can gimme
a ride.
He's already walking around the car to get in the other
side. Gabriella smiles in spite of herself and reaches
over to unlock the door for him.
GABRIELLA
(as he climbs in)
Aren't you working?
JASON
It's my lunch break..
GABRIELLA
Well, let's not tell the boss I
stole you.

Gabriella drives fast and well.
JASON
Did you do something? Or was it

GABRIELLA

Just. They said they.were --

Jason laughs.
JASON
Like they're a factory?
GABRIELLA
The size of their staff? It is.
JASON
Hang a left.
GABRIELLA
Not for the wharf.
JASON
I know. Just turn!
She whips the car through the turn, narrowly missing
another car.
GABRIELLA
(SHOUTING)
Idiot!
JASON
-- Cool.
She laughs; she's starting to relax.
55 INT. REESES' WINE ROOM - DAY 55
Alex and Mike watch victor checking out the humidifier,

COUGHING.
VICTOR (O.S.)
(DISTANTLY)
Goddamn fiberglass --
His head drops through the hatch.
VICTOR
-- Either of, you know how to kill
the water to the house?
MIRE
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Mike starts down the stairs. Alex signals to Victor that
he's going with him and follows Mike away. Victor waits
until he hears the DOOR CLOSE before dropping down through
the hatch and heading for Frank's office.
57
57 EXT. MIAMI RIVER - DAY
Gabriella watches Jason walk with a long stride toward
Henry's boat. She likes the way he moves. Henry is
nearby drinking beer with some Haitians. Jason talks to

Gabriella to come down.

Mike climbs out of the bushes with injured dignity.
MIKE
Okay, you do it.
GUARD
(QUIETLY)
Is he the homeowner?
ALEX
(CHEERFULLY)
No.
59
59 INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY
Victor, wearing surgical gloves, is in the file closet
cracking the safe. He has re-wired the alarm wire with
electrical clips to avoid breaking the circuit. He smears
the sweat off his forehead and leans back in close to the
dial, rotating it carefully back and forth until the
tumblers fall. It opens. victor sifts through papers,
foreign currency.
ALEX (O.S.)
(CALLING OUT)
Harold?
Victor hears the FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. He keeps
searching, but the pressure tells, and his breathing
becomes a wheeze.
60
60 INT. LANDING - DAY
The new guard follows Alex onto the landing. They hear a
DOOR SHUT. The guard instinctively touches his gun.

they round the corner.
VICTOR
(BREEZILY)
You can turn the water back on.
It's not the pipes.
Wearing work gloves, he repositions the hatch cover.
GUARD
Nobody's supposed to be in the house
unaccompanied.
ALEX
Is that our fault?
GUARD
(GRUDGINGLY)
No.
ALEX
All right, then.
The guard glances up at the hatch. In that moment victor
winks at Alex; he scored.
62 EXT. HENRY'S BOAT-- DAY 62
Jason drops anchor in turquoise waters off a sand bar, no
other boats around. Gabriella takes in the idyllic
surroundings.
JASON
You can learn on the fish around
here, but you can't eat 'em.
They're junk fish.
GABRIELLA
Will you teach me?
He laughs.
JASON
Oh, you think you're ready for that
kind of commitment?
(CONTINUED)

62 CONTINUED: 62
She grins and shrugs.
GABRIELLA
I'm only investing an afternoon.
She takes in the landscape, breathing in the lovely
isolation.
GABRIELLA
Where are we?
JASON
My father used to bring me here.
She hears something in his tone.
GABRIELLA
(GENTLY)
No more?
Jason concentrates on securing the boat.
JASON
He's dead. He drowned in a storm.
She shivers involuntarily.
JASON
He was a fisherman.
GABRIELLA
I don't know if I would like boats
after that.
He smiles.
JASON
I feel close to him when I'm on the
water.
GABRIELLA
How old were you?
JASON
-- Eight. I'd just turned eight.
She takes his hand. He tightens his fingers through hers
and looks out at the horizon, trying to control the
emotions her sympathy has roiled. Gabriella senses this.
She puts her arms around him, kisses him on the cheek.
They stand, holding each other. Then Jason, on impulse,
kisses her on the lips.

63 INT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - DAY
The KEY is heard in the LOCK, the door opens, Victor and
Alex come in, giddy with success. Reverentially, Victor
unpacks-the necklace and holds it up for them both to
admire; the object of desire.
VICTOR
(BREATHING OUT)
- Beautiful. Unusual cut. Look at
the fire. Hold it up to the light.
He hands the necklace to Alex, who lifts it up to look at
it. Victor reaches into a drawer. In itHttheeree'ss a gun

What the fuck are you doing??
VICTOR
I always take a photograph of the

the sale. The insurance photo is
hopeless. You ask yourself how do
they stay in business.
Alex advances on him.
ALEX
You put me in the shot.
VICTOR
(MODESTLY)
Speaking of insurance.
Alex is closing on him. His voice is low and menacing.
ALEX
Give me the film, Victor._
victor's hand glides into the drawer. Alex sensibly stops
short.
VICTOR

We'll tear it up together whet. we

victor's hand reappears, holding not a gun but an airline
ticket, which he gives to Alex.

VICTOR

Maybe I am. All right, I am.

He looks at the ticket.

I don't fly economy.

Her laugh cuts him off.
GABRIELLA
I am not taking my clothes off.
JASON
(flustered, irritated)
That's not what I meant.
ONTO
He reels the line out of the water. Gabriella climbs
the rail. She's barefoot. The breeze blows her thin
dress against her legs.

She dives into the water. He kicks off his shoes, dives
in after her.

65 INT. WINE STORE - DAY
The store is closed. Robert has gone home. Alex opens
the cash drawer and takes out all the money, fattens his
wallet. He spies the message from Gabriella. He reads
it, picks up the phone, punches in the number she wrote.
ALEX
... May I speak with Gabriella?
Puedo hablar con Gabriella?
(making a face)
No, yo no quiero dejar un mesajo,
gracias. Voy a llamarla mas tarde.
...Si. Buenas tardes.
He hangs up and speed-dials a number from the typed list
on the wall.
ALEX

need a couple of tickets to New York
for tonight, first class.

Don't sweat the account, I'll pay
CASH --
66
66 EXT. BOAT - DAY
Jason is sprawled half across Gabriella on the deck of the-
boat, a seat cushion under her head. He has his hand in
her panties. She clutches his wrist and pulls his hand
back into sight. He lifts his head to look at her.
GABRIELLA
(SOFTLY)
I can't.
He sits up, offended.
JASON
You waited long enough to tell me.
Gabriella arranges her clothes.

66 CONTINUED:
GABRIELLA
(FLARING)
Because it felt good, and I'm an
idiot!
He fondly touches her face with the back of his hand.
JASON
No, you're not.
She scrambles to her feet.
GABRIELLA
I want to go back now. Can we go
back, please?
JASON
... Sure.
He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with
injured dignity.
Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in
front of her.
Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and
her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does.
She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion.
He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over
the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts to
CLANK.
JASON
I'm sorry.
She turns her head toward him.
GABRIELLA
What?
JASON
(LOUDER)
I'm sorry!
GABRIELLA
Me, too.

Skyscrapers swagger down either side of the river, their
windows bright squares against the darkening sky. The
signal BELL SOUNDS.
68
68 INT. GABRIELLA'S COUSIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
The dinner hour. The table in the mean little house is
too crowded and too noisy; the television on the buffet
can hardly be heard. Gabriella's Cousin and her Husband
are arguing in Spanish, in a good-natured marital way, the
Kids too busy teasing each other to notice. One Kid gets
up to raise the volume on the TV set even louder.
Gabriella carries her plate into the kitchen to escape the
noise. The Husband makes a gesture to his Wife that says
Gabriella's snooty.
69
69 INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT
Gabriella stands at the counter, listlessly finishing her
dinner. The PHONE RINGS. She answers it.
GABRIETMA

ALEX (V.0.)
Don't worry, it's not Ohio.
She laughs.
72 INT. SUZANNE'S CAR - NIGHT 72
Suzanne turns onto their street, pulls into the garage.
She sees Alex's Cadillac already parked.
73 EXT. CAR - NIGHT 73
She locks her car and walks toward the elevator, carrying
a department store shopping bag. The garage is darker
than she likes. Her HEELS ECHO against the cement walls.
She walks a little faster.
74 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 74
Suzanne lets herself in. Alex didn't set the alarm. She
sets the bag on the couch, next to his jacket. She's been
a wife too long not to tidy up after him. She picks up
the jacket to brush it and hang it correctly, and glimpses
the airline tickets tucked in the inside pocket. Suzanne
smiles, moved. The tickets to Rio. She takes a peek to
see the dates. Her face changes. She drops the jacket in
a heap on the floor. She hears ALEX MOVING around in the
bedroom above and starts up the stairs, her rage climbing
with every riser. She can hear him HUMMING.
75 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 75
Alex zips his passport into an outside compartment where
he can reach it. He has almost finished packing. As he
reaches for his underwear, he startles. Suzanne is
leaning against the door frame.
SUZANNE
(CONTROLLED)
Where are you going?
Alex recovers quickly.
(CONTINUED)
52.
75 CONTINUED: 75
ALEX
Napa. I got a problem with a
supplier. Boutique wineries --
they're all owned by ex-lawyers.
SUZANNE
Via New York?
She holds up the tickets.
ALEX
I need to see the wholesaler.
SUZANNE
You're amazing, you really are. Now
how are you going to explain 'Miss
Vasquez?'
ALEX
Honey, I don't have to. I will, out
of courtesy. It's Mrs., and she's
fifty years old, Suzanne. She's the
agent.
SUZANNE
God, I could even believe you, if I
wanted to.
ALEX
(HARDER)
I don't want to fight with you on my
way out the door. I don't have time
for this.
Yanking the tickets out of her hand before she can react,
he pushes past her with his bag. She follows him down the
stairs.
SUZANNE
I put Terry's life insurance money
into that store -- and you spend it
on your goddamn girlfriends while my
checks bounce.
Alex whirls around at the bottom of the stairs.
ALEX
I worked my ass off for you with
that store. Eight years of twelve-
hour days and one-day weekends! So
don't tell me I haven't treated you
well.

53.
75 CONTINUED: (2) 75
He picks his jacket up off the floor and shrugs it on.
Suzanne snatches his car keys off the coffee table.
Infuriated, he grabs for his keys, but she holds them away
behind her back.
SUZANNE
-- You're going to talk to me!
ALEX
When I get back.
SUZANNE
With more of your fucking lies! I
hate you! Wasting my

with her free hand)

ALEX
Sssh, calm down --
She tries to slap him again, but he gets hold of her hand.
ALEX
-- Give me my keys, I need my keys.
I don't want to hurt you.
SUZANNE
That's all you ever do!
He twists her hand up behind her back, forcing her onto
the sofa.
SUZANNE
Go to hell!
He smothers her into the cushion and twists her hand up
and up. She grips his keys tighter.
ALEX
(breathless from the
STRUGGLE)
Open your hand, Suzanne.
Pinning her down, he painfully pries open her fingers.
She drives her elbow into his face.
SUZANNE
You sonofabitch!
He hits her back, her nose starts to gush, the keys drop
to the-floor. He bends to pick them up. Suzanne seizes
a standing metal ashtray and savagely swipes him across
the temple.
(CONTINUED)
54.
75
75 CONTINUED: (3)
The blow sends him sprawling to the floor; he doesn't
move. She is stunned by what she has done. In a panic
she races up the stairs, the heel of her hand to her nose
to staunch the bleeding.
76
76 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Suzanne spills everything out of Alex's suitcase and
starts throwing in her own clothes, blood-spotting them in
her haste.
77
77 INT. JASON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Suzanne jerks out his drawers so fast that she dumps them
on the floor. She pulls his suit out of the closet along
with an armful of other clothes.
78 INT. CONDO, STAIRS - NIGHT 78
Suzanne drags two suitcases clattering down the stairs.
ALEX
hasn't moved. Suzanne drops to her knees beside him and
squeamishly lifts his wallet out of his pocket, snatches
the cash, lets the wallet fall back beside him. Her
breathing is so rapid and shallow it sounds like whimpers.
79 EXT. CONDO - NIGHT 79
Suzanne backs out the door pulling the suitcases, right
into Jason. She cries out in fright.
JASON
-- Hey, hey.
SUZANNE

80 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 80
Ready to kill, Jason is shocked to see the job apparently
already done for him. He bends over Alex to see if he's
dead, and is equally sorry and relieved to find out he
isn't.
SUZANNE (O.S.)
I won't wait for you!
Jason takes the stairs two at a time.
81 INT. JASON'S ROOM - NIGHT 81
He yanks his map of the Gulf off the wall and grabs his
fishing gear.
82 INT. CONDO, DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT 82
Alex's unconscious body blocks the closet. door. Jason
tries to open it anyway, but Alex is 'too heavy. Seizing
hold of him, Jason drags him away from the door. The
jewelry pouch spills out of Alex's pocket. Jason doesn't
see it. The HORN BLARES, outside. Jason pulls his rod out
of the closet. As he steps over Alex, he spots the pouch,
the drawstring loose enough to let the necklace protrude.
The HORN BLASTS again. Jason swoops up the pouch.
83 EXT. CONDO.- NIGHT 83
Jason runs for the car with his gear and climbs in.
Suzanne peels away before the door is completely closed.
84 INT. CAR - NIGHT (TRAVELING) - 84
Jason and Suzanne. She can't look at him. She

On the verge of hysteria, she's laughing so hard, she can
hardly drive. Tears run down her face, muddying the dried
blood; she's a holy mess.
JASON
Pull over, pull over.
He wrenches the wheel and steers the car to the curb.
JASON
I'm driving.

He gets out and lopes around the car to the driver's side.
The car recedes down the highway.

sand was as white as the whites of
God's eyes, on the Gulf.
JASON
Do you still miss him?
Slowly she shakes her head no.
SUZANNE
I can't see his face anymore. I
can't hear his voice.
(DREAMILY)
-- But when you come home from
fishing -- with the sea and the salt
and the engine oil? It's like he's

She watches the highway posts clack past.
