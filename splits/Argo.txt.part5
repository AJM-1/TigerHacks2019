Taylor comes in, drink in hand, thoughts heavy, looks at
Tony.
MENDEZ
So you know.
TAYLOR

ExtAff wants you to burn the

Mendez looks at the Houseguests, setting the table.

226 INT. CAR - NIGHT 226
Mendez drives through nighttime Tehran, back to the

KATHY STAFFORD

He's late.
235 EXT. SHERATON BALCONY - DAWN 235
Tony comes out to the balcony with a hotel ice bucket in
one hand and the Canadian passports in the other. He
puts the passports in the bucket, LIGHTS A MATCH.
He looks down at the match, at the passports. The first
stirring of the morning calls-to-prayer echo in the
distance.
HOLD for a long beat ON Tony. Thinking.
Then, HE BLOWS OUT THE MATCH.
236 INT. O'DONNELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 236
O'Donnell is packing up for the night. Paper towels sit

duffel bag over his shoulder, Tony turns out the light in
the hotel room. Gs.
238 INT. CIA (LANGLEY) - O'DONNELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 238
O'Donnell, thinking. Looking at the phone. Then, with a
sudden decision, he gets up.
Rushing out of his office, into --
239 INT. CIA - THE PIT - NIGHT 239
-- where he catches ALAN SOSA, 50s, head of the
Directorate of Support -- the CIA's chief financial
officer -- leaving for the night.
O'DONNELL
We need to confirm those seven
tickets out of Tehran on
SWISSAIR --
SOSA
N.E. shut that down.
O'DONNELL
I'm saying it's back on!
SOSA
I can't do it. It's backstopped
pending Executive Branch GO.
O'DONNELL
What the fuck ds that mean?
SOSA
Carter's got to say yes for us to
get the tickets.

She's shocked to see him. Ken Taylor now appears behind
Pat. In the hall behind him: The Houseguests are
assembled, waiting to go. They look their parts -- or,
much more so than they did on the scout. Cora Lijek has
darker hair. The Staffords look on, fully dressed.

Cora Lijek fingers her yellow immigration form in one

Malinov slams a phone down.

256 INT. WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF OFFICE - NIGHT (PRESENT) 256
Jordan is in a meeting with two staffers, his feet up on

JORDAN
Hello?
O'DONNELL (V.O.)
Jack O'Donnell from C.I.
JORDAN
Wait -- WHO -- ?
O'DONNELL (V.O.)
Tehran Houseguest operation is

261 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - FIRST CHECKPOINT - MORNING 261
The PASSPORT OFFICIAL is looking at the Canadian
passports of the six and waving them through. Mendez has
already passed. Everyone except Kathy Stafford.
The Passport Official looks at Kathy, who is doing her
best to look friendly and casual. Then he looks at
Kathy's passport, in which she looks stern and angry.
Kathy Stafford smoothes down her hair, frowns like she
ds in the passport photo. The Passport Official half
smiles and waves her through. They've all cleared the
first checkpoint.
262 INT. KOMITEH HQ - MORNING 262
Khalkali comes upon a diplomatic photograph of a man with
glasses.
He starts to leaf through the photographs from the

265 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - SECOND CHECKPOINT - MORNING 265
Bob Anders stands in front of a rough-voiced IMMIGRATION
OFFICER. He's holding Bob Anders' YELLOW IMMIGRATION
FORM and leafing through a file of hundreds of WHITE
IMMIGRATION FORMS, the duplicates. Without success.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER #2
(in Farsi; to Officer
#1, re: his own
WHITE PILE)
Nothing.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
(to Bob Anders)
When did you say you arrived in
Iran?
BOB ANDERS
Two days ago.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER
What was the purpose of your
visit?
BOB ANDERS
We were looking at locations to
make a film. I'm the director.
Immigration Officer pauses and looks up. Looks at the
six other faces. He looks every bit as confrontational
as Tony acted in rehearsal.
BOB ANDERS
(VERY CALM)
We have a letter from the Minister
of Culture ...
The Immigration Officer gestures for the letter. Bob
takes the letter inviting them on their location scout
out of a folder. Tony, barely perceptibly, nods.
266 INT. KOMITEH HQ - MORNING 266
Khalkali is now speaking with MORADI, an older Komiteh
official. They speak Farsi and it's untranslated, but we
get it. He is showing the photograph of Mark Lijek from
the bazaar and comparing it to the U.S. diplomatic
photograph.
Moradi picks up the phone as Khalkali heads out.

They are within sight of the Argo bungalow, but a P.A.
steps in front of them.
P.A.

police procedural -- is shooting on the lot between them
and the office.
271 INT. AIRPORT GATE - MORNING 271

272 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING 272
Mendez checks in with the Houseguests with his eyes.
They are now in sight of the airport gates. And here are
six Komiteh. Young men -- none more than 33 or so --
holding automatic weapons.
They have created their own checkpoint. It looks recent,
A SCREENED-OFF AREA WITH TABLES.
KOMITEH #1
Passports.
He looks at the Canadian passports and then almost
immediately speaks.
KOMITEH #1
You come.
He directs Mendez and the Houseguests into the screened-
off area. Speaks in Farsi to another Komiteh.
273 INT. CIA - THE PIT - NIGHT 273
LAMONT

AZIZI (O.S.)
Sit down.
A young man with a beard -- AZIZI, late 20s -- arriving
on the scene, speaking in Farsi to the others and then in
very good American English. He looks at the six and the

AZIZI

FARSI)
You. You had no business in Iran.
He motions for J STAFFORD to step forward. Mendez
shifts. A tense moment.
J STAFFORD
(FARSI)
We did. We were preparing to make
a movie here, sir.
AZIZI
(FARSI)
You don't have journalist visas.
J STAFFORD
(FARSI)
Not a documentary. A movie.
J Stafford reaches into his pocket and gives Azizi a
copy of the Argo Variety ad.
J STAFFORD
(FARSI)
You see?
(to Mendez; English)
Kevin, where's your briefcase?
A beat on Mendez. Who then opens his accordion folder
and takes from it the ARGO STORYBOARDS. J Stafford
spreads them out on the table.
Three other Komiteh in the room lean forward, their
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at their sides, and look at the
STORYBOARD DRAWINGS. The Persian Empire futurism of Jack
Kirby's drawings.
J STAFFORD
(FARSI)
These are the villains. Y'see
these guys here? And these are
the hers... in the spice
market...
J Stafford points at the various drawings. He speaks
with an ease and confidence that we didn't know he had.
J STAFFORD
(FARSI)
They know our hero is the Chosen
One, so they kidnap his son in the
spice market ... They have these
chariots... like this one...

Mendez watches. It's a performance. The three young
Komiteh are now wide-eyed, pointing, whispering in Farsi,
like teenagers around a comic book.
Azizi says something to another Komiteh in the room.
THEN --
AZIZI
(to J Stafford; in
ENGLISH)
You don't go until we verify.
MENDEZ
You can call our office.
Mendez hands Azizi his card. STUDIO SIX FILMS. Kevin
Harkins. A 213 (818 wasn't around yet) phone number.
ANGLES ON THE HOUSEGUESTS
as Azizi leaves the room with the business card and three
young Komiteh barely look up from the drawings --
275 EXT. WARNER BROS. STUDIOS - NIGHT 275
P.A., still holding Chambers and Siegel. The ACTOR

Azizi dials the long international number. And it is a
DIAL, so this takes a long time.
280 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING 280
One of the young Komiteh is loudly debating with another
Komiteh the air-worthiness of a futuristic desert glider
in the storyboards. He's miming the thing crashing.
J Stafford and the Houseguests are silent. Mendez can
see the line of passengers on their Swissair flight
dwindling.
281 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - KOMITEH STATION - MORNING 281
Azizi rings the phone three times -- four times -- he's

Azizi comes back into the screened-off area. Looks at
J Stafford, then at Mendez. Then says something in
Farsi to the three Komiteh in the holding area. Then he
leaves.
The three young Komiteh look at the drawings, then at J
Stafford. Silence for a moment.
MENDEZ
(PUSHES THE
STORYBOARDS TOWARD
THEM)
Our gift to you. From our film.
Komiteh #1, who speaks enough English to understand,
translates to the others. They forget their
revolutionary mission for a second, happy with their
gift. They'd high-five if they could. They're kids.
Komiteh #1 motions for the Houseguests to go.
ARGO - Final 109.
289 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - FOYER - MORNING 289
Khalkali and a dozen Komiteh, guns drawn, rush into the
