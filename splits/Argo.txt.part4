the door. Tony hides the passports. Answers
the door.
BELLHOP
Sir, a telex arrived for you.
The BELLHOP hands Tony a piece of paper. He reads it.
CUT TO:
ARGO - Final 74.
193 INT. SHERATON ROOM - NIGHT 193
Mendez takes a small 1978 model radio out of his
suitcase. He unscrews the casing and from inside takes
out what looks like a 6-inch transistor board for the
radio.
On either side of the board: telephone jacks.
He detaches the cords from the hotel phone and plugs them
into the jacks on the transistor board. It's a phone
scrambler.
MENDEZ (V.O.)
The Minister of Culture and
Guidance has approved your
location scout.'
194 INT. SHERATON ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 194
Mendez, on the phone --
MENDEZ
(reading the telefax)
He will send a representative to
meet you and your crew at the
Khayyam entrance to the Grand
Bazaar tomorrow at 3 PM.'
INTERCUT WITH:
195 INT. O'DONNELL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 195
O'Donnell on the phone.
O'DONNELL
They called your bluff.
MENDEZ
Or maybe they're cooperating.
O'DONNELL
N.E. says absolutely not. Seven
Americans walking the bazaar,
you're asking for a riot, it's the
HIVE --
MENDEZ
Seven Canadians, Jack.
O'DONNELL
Never give them multiple shots at
a cover. Are they even ready?
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 75.
195 CONTINUED: 195
MENDEZ
They're getting there.
O'DONNELL
Terrific. There's no prize for
Most Improved.'
MENDEZ
(ESCALATING)
I don't have a choice. We say no,
they come to the residence and
pull everyone out at gunpoint.
How do you think the covers hold
up with their fingernails pulled
out?
196 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 196
Mark Lijek is studying pages from the envelope Tony gave
him. J Stafford is sitting near him, having a drink,
watching Iranian State Television footage of the
Ayatollah. J Stafford translates out loud.
J STAFFORD
We are a nation of 35 million
and... many of these people are
looking forward to martyrdom.
Kathy Stafford looks into the room. J stops talking,
looks up.
J STAFFORD
(TO KATHY)
Five minutes?
He smiles at her. Kathy, who looks like she hasn't been
sleeping, nods and leaves. J takes a drink. After a
MOMENT --
J STAFFORD
She pleaded with me.
Mark, looking to J. This is new.
J STAFFORD
When it started in the streets
nine months ago. She begged for
us to leave. She packed our bags.
I said, A little longer.' And
what I was thinking was, This is
a good thing for me. Stay. Show
Newsom you've got the balls. Grab
for the ring.'

ARGO - Final 76.

J STAFFORD (CONT'D)
(A BEAT)
I think we're gonna die here.
197 INT. KOMITEH HEADQUARTERS (AMIR ABAD DISTRICT) - DAY 197
The feeling here is dangerous. Young men carrying
automatic weapons casually.
Behrouz stands next to ALI KHALKALI, 30s, a Revolutionary
Committee security official. There are RECONSTRUCTED
EMBASSY PICTURES ON THE WALL.
We see the FAMOUS PICTURES OF THE HOSTAGES BEING MARCHED
DOWN THE STEPS.
197A INT. KOMITEH HEADQUARTERS STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 197A
A Kafka-esque stairway. We see a YOUNG KOMITEH call up
from the bottom and head up the stairs.
JUMP CUT TO: one flight to go.
Now on the level WITH CAMERA, we carry him INTO the
office as he hands off the ARGO script and STUDIO SIX
BUSINESS CARD. Khalkali has some words in Farsi for the
young man.
198 EXT. SHERATON BALCONY - MORNING 198
Tony looks at one of the Argo storyboards -- one
depicting an EXOTIC SPICE MARKET, a BAZAAR -- in the
light.
CORA LIJEK (V.O.)
This isn't what we agreed to.
199 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KEN'S OFFICE - 199
MORNING
The Houseguests are gathered in the office. Cora hands
the telefax to Bob Anders. J Stafford, looking on.
CORA LIJEK
You said a day to learn your
covers then straight to the
airport.' You said that.
BOB ANDERS
They suspect something?
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 77.
199 CONTINUED: 199
MENDEZ
What I know is we need to act like
a movie crew. We go to the bazaar
today, we fly out tomorrow.
Silent assent among the group. Then J Stafford,
sitting with his wife, speaks up --
J STAFFORD
We won't do it.
MARK LIJEK
He told them there were six of us.
They're expecting six.
J STAFFORD
(TO MENDEZ)
You are about to show the only
card we're holding. Which is that
they don't know we're here.
MENDEZ
I'm asking you to trust me.
J STAFFORD
I don't trust you.
BOB ANDERS
(fed up, to J)
What's the alternative? This is
the ball game, J. What world
are you living in?
J STAFFORD
The one where they're hanging
people from construction cranes,
Bob.
J takes Kathy's hand and gs, leaving Mendez with the
others. After a moment --
MARK LIJEK
(TO MENDEZ)
So we'll see you at two?
200 INT. CARPET FACTORY - MORNING 200
A KOMITEH BOSS inspects the work of the CARPET WEAVER
KIDS -- whose numbers have grown into the HUNDREDS -- as
they labor quietly.
Some HEADSHOTS are in various stages of repair.
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 78.
200 CONTINUED: 200
Dozens of documents are now complete, sitting on the
floor in rows. Some pages from the EMBASSY MUG BOOK are
now re-assembled. The boss picks one of the pages up:
meticulously worked so that text and photos are now
intact.
201 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY 201
PAT TAYLOR
This one.
She gives Bob Anders a Canadian maple leaf lapel pin,
which he affixes to his shirt. Cora Lijek paints lighter
hair dye onto her hair. The Houseguests are making
subtle efforts to disguise themselves.
CORA LIJEK
(at a mirror, quoting
INSTRUCTIONS)
So don't be recognizable, but look
exactly like your passport
picture.
MARK LIJEK
Not that picture. You won't want
to scare them.
A nervous smile. Trying to deal with anxiety.
J and Kathy Stafford look to each other. Sitting
reading newspapers while the other Houseguests prep for
the scout. The PHONE starts ringing.
PAT TAYLOR
(answering the phone)
Hello?
A cloud comes over Pat as she listens.
PAT TAYLOR
No, there's no one like that here.
She hangs up the phone fast, as if it were hot to the
touch.
BOB ANDERS
Who was it?
Pat shakes her head.
ON J STAFFORD
listening. Kathy takes his hand.
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 79.
201 CONTINUED: 201
KATHY STAFFORD
(TO J)
Somebody knows.
202 INT. SHERATON ROOM - DAY 202
Tony getting dressed. Thinking.
He gets up and leaves, and we start to hear the sound of
a man talking fast in Farsi.
203 EXT. CAR RENTAL - DAY 203
It's a CAR RENTAL MAN, 60s, speaking. Tony is looking at
a MINIVAN on a lot of beaten-up rental cars.
MENDEZ
This one, how much? One day, how
much?
204 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY 204
Four of the Houseguests are waiting on the couch, dressed
in their best approximation of the clothes of a movie
scout crew. Cora has the maple leaf flag pin on her
shirt.
They turn when they see Tony come in the door.
Tony as he steps down into the living room, down the hall
--
205 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY 205
... to find J Stafford sitting at the table. They are
badly shaken.
MENDEZ
I promise you that if you will
play along today, I will get you
out tomorrow.
J STAFFORD
I wish I could believe you, Mr.
Harkins.
MENDEZ
My name is Tony Mendez.
Mendez gs back out to the minivan. STAY WITH J and
Kathy.
ARGO - Final 80.
206 INT. MINIVAN - DAY 206
Mendez, in the driver's seat, looks at the house, then at
his watch. He starts up the van, filled with four of the
Houseguests.
Then he looks in the rearview and sees one of the back
doors open. J and Kathy Stafford board.
207 EXT. TEHRAN - DAY 207
Tony drives the minivan through streets of Tehran. The
Houseguests sit in silence, looking out the windows.
There is a vehement DEMONSTRATION going on -- stars-and-
stripes burning in Molavi Square -- and it's taking place
right in their way.
They stop at the demonstration, then realize people
aren't passing by as much as celebrating in the street.
Tony is forced to nose his way through the crowd --
chanting and yelling -- some SLAPPING THE WINDOWS.
They finally get through and pull away. With the
demonstration receding behind them, Tony tries to regain
their focus.
MENDEZ
Tell me who you are.
This recalls attention from the windows.

MENDEZ
Let's make a movie.
ARGO - Final 81.
208 EXT. STREET NEAR THE BAZAAR - DAY 208
The minivan double-parks on Musavi Street. Taxis, men
loading and unloading rolled-up carpets onto pickup
trucks, chaos.
A YOUNG MAN IN SUIT WITH NO TIE waits. This is REZA, mid-
20s, a low-level administrator in the Ministry of
Guidance.
Mendez gets out and they speak and shake hands. The
image FREEZES. In a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.
They exchange pleasantries and Reza leads them down a
narrow street toward the bazaar.
209 EXT./INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 209
Reza is leading Mendez and the group of Houseguests
through the Tehran Bazaar. A word about the place: the
world's largest bazaar. 10 kilometers of narrow alleys.
Chinese-made Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers,
fabric stores, gold stands. Boys with hand-trucks loaded
down with piles of fabric cut through the crowd. Older
Islamic architecture elbows up against neon signs and
rickety wooden stands with second-story balconies like
Bourbon Street.
Bob Anders walks toward the front.
REZA
You are the director?
BOB ANDERS
Yes.
REZA
(PLEASANT)
Is this film a foreign bride film?
BOB ANDERS
I'm sorry?
REZA
A film where a foreign bride is
brought to Iran, but she dsn't
understand the language and
customs and there are
misunderstandings and laughs.
BOB ANDERS
No.
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 82.
209 CONTINUED: 209
REZA
(not happy with that)
Mmmm.
Mendez walking toward the back of the group. Lee, the
cameraman, is looking through a viewfinder down the alley
of the bazaar.
MENDEZ
(QUIET)
Mike?
LEE SCHATZ
(not looking up)
Yeh.
MENDEZ
If I said you were looking through
the wrong end of that viewfinder,
would I be right?
Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it
again.
LEE SCHATZ
Yep.
ANGLE
Mendez talking to Lee from a distance. A zoom, a closer
snapshot of LEE. Then of CORA LIJEK, who walks through
the bazaar with an open ARGO SCRIPT in her hand.
The Revolutionary Guard photographer is taking pictures
of each of the Houseguests, picking their portraits off
one by one like a sniper.
210 EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE (TEHRAN) - DAY 210
Two sedans turn onto the property and head up the
driveway.
Ali Khalkali, the revolutionary official, gets out of one
of the cars. He's joined by a couple other OFFICIALS and
by two armed REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS.
Sahar is moving through the garden, she sees the men
approach. She gs to greet them at the gate.
SAHAR
(Farsi, from behind
THE GATE)
Yes?
ARGO - Final 83.
211 OMITTED 211
212 INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 212
Reza leads Mendez and the Houseguests deeper into this
city within a city; fundamentalist ground zero. BAZAARIS
stand at their shop doors; puzzled; unfriendly; watching
the visitors.
Kathy Stafford, the production designer on the scout,
takes a Polaroid of a window adorned in gold. The
SHOPKEEPER, a 70-ish bazaari, sees her do so.
He hurries out of his store, speaking in rapid-fire Farsi
at her. The Houseguests stop. Reza speaks to the
Shopkeeper.
REZA
(TO KATHY)
He wants the photograph you took.
MENDEZ
She's the production designer.
Her job is to take photographs.
SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi.
REZA
He says he did not give you
permission to take a photograph of
his store.
Other BAZAARIS and SHOPPERS are starting to gather.
Kathy holds out the Polaroid toward the Shopkeeper.
KATHY STAFFORD
He can have the photograph. Tell
HIM --
The Shopkeeper knocks the Polaroid out of her hand.

KHALKALI
(FARSI)
The guests of the ambassador. How
long have they been in this house?
214 INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 214
People are now starting to surround Mendez and Reza and
the Houseguests. Bazaaris more and more heated. Women
in chadors are screaming and finger-pointing.
ANGRY MAN
(IN ENGLISH)
America NO!... NO!
Then he speaks in Farsi and makes shooting gestures with
his hand.
LEE SCHATZ
(quiet, to Mendez)
He's saying the Shah killed his
son with an American gun.
Cauldron heating up and --
215 INT./EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE - 215

ON Sahar -- her face impassive -- and then --
SAHAR

Two days. They arrived two days
ago.
Khalkali looks to the other Officials.
216 INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - ANGLE ON MORE AND MORE BAZAARIS - 216
DAY
A CROWD starts to gather around the group.
ON KATHY
Her claustrophobia as the crowd closes in -- an ANGRY
BAZAARI WOMAN sticks her finger in Kathy's face --
CORA LIJEK
(to one of the women)
Canada... Ca-na-da...
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 85.
216 CONTINUED: 216
She's showing a Canadian flag, Bob Anders' lapel button --
LEE SCHATZ

He says we're the CIA taking
photographs to plan the bombing of
the city.
217 INT./EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE - 217
DAY
Khalkali eyes Sahar, gauging her. She hides her fear
well.
KHALKALI
(FARSI)
Sister, those who are with him,
Rasool of Allah, we are tender
among ourselves.
(BEAT)
But stern against the kuffar.
SAHAR
As god wills it.
KHALKALI
(QUOTING MOSSADEGH)
But those who sit silently have
sinned.
Ds he know? Ds he not know? Is he trying to trick
her? His opacity makes it impossible to know. He holds
his look to her -- and she holds hers.
218 INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 218
Reza indicates an exit to the street.
219 INT./EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE - 219
DAY
-- and Sahar, so dignified and stony she is almost
shaming these men --
SAHAR
Everyone in this house is a friend
of Iran.
Khalkali makes his decision. He wordlessly turns to go.
ARGO - Final 86.
220 INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 220
The CROWD heckles the Houseguests as they walk toward the
exit.
221 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - FOYER - DAY 221
Sahar calmly closes the door.
After she ds, she lets the facade go. All of a sudden
scared. Maybe she tears up. Either way, it's clear she
knows the stakes of the game she is playing.
222 INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - AFTERNOON 222
The aftermath. The Houseguests, badly shaken, come
inside. Each dealing with shock and adrenaline.
Ken Taylor comes up next to Mendez and, for once,
Taylor's ambassadorial calm is breaking.
TAYLOR
They drew you out there to take
your picture.
MENDEZ
Nobody broke.
At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor,
holding Sahar's hand, both looking spooked as the
Houseguests come inside.
TAYLOR
(SOBERED NOW)
And tomorrow?
A beat on Mendez, who stamps out his cigarette and
follows.
MENDEZ
Tomorrow they'll be ready.
We start to hear the sound of the evening's call to
prayer, amplified over a megaphone, in the distance.
THEN --
223-224 OMITTED 223-224
ARGO - Final 87.
224A MONTAGE - EXT. TEHRAN - DUSK 224A
The call to prayer echoing as night falls in Tehran. In
an alley where cloaked women hurry past posters of
Khomeini. On a street where a five-year-old boy, in the
care of his eight-year-old brother, watches a pickup
truck of armed komiteh speed past.
224B INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT 224B
Mendez holds a passport and some papers in front of Bob
Anders' face. It feels late. The Houseguests are tired,
sweating, sitting around a dining room. Mendez, sleeves
rolled up, drilling them. The ARGO STORYBOARDS are
scattered around the room.
MENDEZ
Where was your passport issued?
Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests.
ANDERS
Vancouver.
MENDEZ
Where were you born?
BOB ANDERS
Toronto.
MENDEZ
Toronno like piranha. Canadians
don't pronounce the T.
LEE SCHATZ
Some border guard's gonna know
that?
MENDEZ
If you're held for questioning,
they'll bring in somebody who
knows that.
MENDEZ

Last three Canadian prime
minsters.

MENDEZ
Associate Producer. What's the
name of the last film you worked
on?
J STAFFORD
Uh... High and Dry.
MENDEZ
Who paid for the movie?
J STAFFORD
C.F.D.C.
MENDEZ
What's your middle name?
J Stafford is silent. He looks down to consult the
paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls
the paper.
MENDEZ
He's an American spy. Shoot him.
A beat on Stafford, frustrated --
MENDEZ
They'll try to break you by
getting you agitated. You need to
know your rÃ©sumÃ© so well that you
don't flinch.
J STAFFORD
(nearly defeated,
LOOKING AWAY)
You think your little story will
matter when there's guns to our
heads?
MENDEZ
My story's the only thing between
you and the gun to your head.
A beat. Mendez puts the rÃ©sumÃ© back in front of
Stafford. Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't
good at this.

MALINOV

O'Donnell ignores him. He gs straight to his office.
Looking like he's seen a ghost.
224D EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - VERANDA - NIGHT 224D
Mendez, finishing a cigarette outside. We might hear the
distant sound of a phone ringing.
Ken Taylor emerges. Waits a beat.
TAYLOR

224E INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - KEN TAYLOR'S 224E
OFFICE - CROSS-CUTTING - NIGHT
Mendez picks up the complicated-looking satellite phone
in Ken Taylor's home office. As soon as he ds --
O'DONNELL
Go to black on green.
Jack's calling him here, so he knows something's wrong.
MENDEZ
What is it?
O'DONNELL
Go to black on green.
Mendez turns knobs on the satellite phone.

O'DONNELL
It all just changed. They called
the game. You've got to come
back.
ON Mendez, not believing what he's hearing.
O'DONNELL
(quiet, fast, clear)
Joint Chiefs are planning a
military rescue of the hostages in
a month. Delta Force started
training to storm the grounds. So
if the six of them get brought
down there, they won't be held for
long.
MENDEZ
I never would have exposed them if
I wasn't authorized to take them
out.
O'DONNELL
It's over, Tony.
MENDEZ
They will be taken. Probably not
ALIVE --
O'DONNELL
LISTEN TO ME. The thinking's
changed. Six Americans get pulled
out of a Canadian diplomat's house
and executed, it's another world
outrage. Six Americans get caught
playing movie make-believe with
the CIA at the airport and
executed, it's a national
embarrassment. They're calling
the operation.
MENDEZ
We're responsible for those
people.
O'DONNELL
(GENUINELY SAD)
What we are is required to follow
orders. I'm sorry.
Mendez hangs up. O'Donnell sits listening to the dial
tone for a moment, then puts the phone on the receiver.

Maybe only a minute, maybe ten or more have passed.
Mendez sits at Taylor's desk, numb. Cora Lijek knocks
but dsn't get a response. She tentatively opens the
door and sticks her head inside.
CORA LIJEK
We're ready to try again.
MENDEZ

I think the most important thing
