She should be your screenwriter.
Sometimes they go on scouts cause
they want the free meals.
(re: Bob Anders)
This guy's the director.
MENDEZ
Can you teach a guy how to be a
director in a day?
CHAMBERS
You can teach a rhesus monkey to
be a director in a day. Look, if
you're gonna do it, you've got to
do it. The Khomaniacs are fruit
loops, but they have cousins
selling eight tracks and prayer
rugs on La Brea. You can't build
cover stories around a movie that
dsn't exist. You need a script.
You need a producer.
MENDEZ
I'm the producer.
CHAMBERS
No, you're not. Associate' at
best. If it's a twenty-million
dollar Star Wars rip-off, you need
somebody who's a somebody to put
his name on it.
Here we see some AUTOGRAPHED 70s CELEBRITY 8X10s hanging
on the wall.
The waiter brings a bill.
CHAMBERS
Somebody respectable. With

SIEGEL

I only got a couple minutes. I'm
getting a lifetime achievement
award tonight.
CHAMBERS

SIEGEL
Aaah, I'd rather stay home and

Chambers gives Mendez a look.

GETS UP)

Chambers stops at the muted television. More images of
angry crowds.
CHAMBERS
You ever think, Lester, how it's
all for the cameras?
SIEGEL
They're getting the ratings, I'll
give em that --
Siegel looks at the TV: at that moment, a HOSTAGE TAKER
holding up photos of hostages for CAMERAS in front of
him. He takes a beat.
SIEGEL
We're gonna need a script.

CHAMBERS

it's a Western.
CHAMBERS

Yeah, Kenny, please. It's John
Chambers, about the office space.

It dsn't matter. It's a fake

KLEIN
You want me to be honest with you,
Les?
SIEGEL
Naah, bullshit me, Max.
KLEIN
Okay. Because I enjoyed your
films, the early ones. I took
this meeting out of respect
because I wanted to tell you no'
to your face.
SIEGEL
Thank you. Very respectful.
KLEIN
You're done, Lester. You've gotta
get your cataracts fixed and read
the trades. MGM just capitalized
for six new films and they're
desperate for Sci-Fi. They've
already offered me four times what
you are.
SIEGEL
(A BEAT)
What can I say? Congratulations.
(shrugs to Mendez)
He's got me.
A beat. Mendez ready to go --
SIEGEL
But see -- it worries me, what you
said, and I'll tell you why. A
couple weeks back I was sitting in
Trader Vic's enjoying a Mai Tai
when my pal Warren Beatty came to
wish me well and we had a little
chat. Seems he was attached to
star in Zulu Empire -- which was
gonna anchor that MGM slate -- but
Warren confided in me that the
picture's gone over-budget cause
the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

SIEGEL (CONT'D)
They may be cannibals swallowing
each other up but they want health
and dental, so the movie's kaput --
which means that MGM deal ain't
gonna happen and your script ain't
worth the buffalo-shit on a
nickel. So.
Lester takes some documents out of a folder.
SIEGEL
The way this looks to me --
through the cataracts, I grant you
-- is that you can either sign
here and take ten thousand for
your toilet-paper script -- or you
can go fuck yourself.
Siegel smiles kindly and holds a pen and the contracts
out to Klein. Klein takes them.
