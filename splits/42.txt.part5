JACK
They're taking the field.
RICKEY
Who's playing first?
Jack considers him. Everything hangs in the balance. Then:

Eight zeros hang for the Phillies. Seven for the Dodgers.
No score, the bottom of the 8th coming up.
134 JACK 134
Steps into the batter's box. Chapman and his sidekicks step
from the Stygian abyss of the visitor's dugout.
PINK REV 4-19-12 81.
CHAPMAN
Hey, black Nigger! I know you can
hear me! If you were a white boy,
you know where you'd be right now?!
On a bus headed down to Newport
News cuz you can't play for shit!
Here comes the pitch. Jack nonchalantly sticks his bat out,
pokes a soft hit past second. A nothing hit, but he's
standing on first. And he looks, well, ferocious in fact.
As Pete Reiser steps up into the batter's box...
Jack stares at Dutch Leonard. Assassin's eyes as he takes an
insolent, in-your-face lead off first.
Dutch fires to first. Jack dives back safe!
Back on his feet, he spits out a piece of grit he picked up
sliding back on his belly. Not bothering to dust himself
off, he's turning into something elemental before our eyes.
135 RED BARBER 135
Up in the booth.
BARBER
Two strikes now to Reiser as
Leonard looks in. Robinson with
another big lead off first. He's as
restless as a cat with a hot foot.

Witnessing.
RACHEL
Steal it, sweetheart. Take it.
137 FIELD 137
Dutch throws. Jack on the run as Reiser swings and misses -
STRIKE THREE! - and Seminick comes up throwing.
Jack slides into second, the throw high, ends up in center.
Half a dozen Dodgers impulsively on their feet and waving him
on as Jack gets to his feet and motors into THIRD. The throw
well late. Phillies third baseman HANDLEY throws the ball
back to Dutch. Handley then looks to Jack.
HANDLEY
I'm sorry. I want you to know what
goes on here, it don't go for me.
Jack barely nods, but he heard.
BLUE REV 4-07-12 82.

Hermanski steps up.

Dutch looking to third, nodding distracted at a sign, looking

Several REPORTERS around Chapman as well. He drinks a BEER.
CHAPMAN
You fellas are making too big a

lost. One to nothing.
REPORTER THREE
Do you think you were a little hard
on Robinson?
CHAPMAN
We treat him the same way we do
Hank Greenburg except we call Hank
a kike instead of a coon. When we
play exhibitions against the
Yankees, we call DiMaggio the Wop.
They laugh at it. No harm, it's
forgotten after the game ends.
Chapman tosses away his beer can.

Don't you think this was maybe one
foot over the line?
CHAPMAN
Hey. Let's get the chips off our
shoulders and play ball. It's a

Rickey sits brooding, thinking. Parrott enters, upset.
PARROTT
I'm going in that Phillie dugout
tomorrow and wring Chapman's neck!
Rickey considers Parrott, starts laughing. Parrott is hurt.
PARROTT
Did I say something funny?
RICKEY
When I first told you about Jackie,
you were against it. Now all of a
sudden you're worrying about him.
How do you suppose that happened?
PARROTT
Well, any decent minded person --
RICKEY
Sympathy, Harold, is a Greek word.
It means to suffer. I sympathize
with you means I suffer with you.
This Philadelphia manager has done
me a service.
PARROTT
A service?!
RICKEY
Is there an echo in here? Yes,
he's creating sympathy on Jackie's
behalf. Philadelphia by the way is
Greek for brotherly love.
The intercom BUZZES.
JANE ANN'S VOICE

RICKEY

RICKEY
What do you want, Bragan?
WHITE 3-14-12 84.
BRAGAN
I'd like not to be traded, sir, if
it isn't too late.
RICKEY
What about Robinson?
Bragan's been staring at the floor. He looks up now. The
low afternoon sun hits his face.
BRAGAN
I'd like to be his teammate.
RICKEY
Why?
BRAGAN
The world's changing; I guess I can
live with the change.
RICKEY

A beat between them, framed by the steel girders around them.

I don't care if they like me; I

He looks over. It's not easy for this most proud of men.

She holds it up. His name the only one filled in.

CHAPMAN
You're here to draw those Nigger

YELLOW REV 4-24-12 86.
Chapman clocks the apoplectic Stanky. Spit flying as:

Sit down. Sit down or I'll sit you

CHAPMAN
What's the problem, Stank?
STANKY
You're the problem, you goddamn
disgrace! What kind of man are
you?! You know he can't fight!
Pick on someone who can fight!
BARBER'S VOICE

Eddie Stanky having a chin wag with
his ex-teammate Chapman. Both men
masters of distraction. Eddie, of

Stanky so mad he can't see straight. Chapman surrenders.

Okay, okay. Jesus.

Over Barber: a CRACK of the bat, the ROAR of the crowd. As
players around him react, Stanky finally looks up as Robinson
crosses the plate, heads in, sits a few feet from Stanky.
JACK
Thanks.
STANKY

SHOTTON
If you're talking about Dixie, I'd
leave the word sheep out of it.
RICKEY
I find myself at odds. I want
integration and the pennant. I
want to punish Dixie and at the

SHOTTON
Can't he just be a good ballplayer?
He has to be a good person, too?

Garagiola signals for another fastball.

I used to think Jack was conceited.
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 93.
RICKEY
Is that so?
RACHEL
It was the very first thing I
noticed about him.
RICKEY
How did you two meet?
RACHEL
I saw him at a UCLA football game.
Even in uniform with a helmet on,
his vanity was awful. It was the
way he held his hands on his hips.
I hated him!
(RICKEY LAUGHS)
And on campus he always wore crisp
white shirts and I'd think his skin
is so dark, why would he do that?
Then I got to know him, his pride
and confidence, and I realized he
was showing off his color. I was
wrong. He wasn't conceited; he was
proud. Always, of who and what he
is. I'd never met another man like
that. What about you? How did you
meet your wife?
RICKEY
Trying to catch her in a race. She
was the fastest girl in town.
Beautiful legs. I finally caught
up; we've been together ever since.
They sit a moment. Below: Jack nails another one.
RICKEY
I wanted to apologize to you.
RACHEL
For what?
RICKEY
Everything. I can't apologize to
him. He and I both knew what we
were getting into. But you. A
newlywed, trying to blossom a
marriage under all this pressure.
RACHEL
Don't worry about me. Or us. We
know who we are.
Crack. Jack hits another.
WHITE 3-14-12 94.
RICKEY
Your husband has humbled me. When
this all began I thought I was
changing the world and that Jackie
was my instrument. Can you
imagine? I wish I could help him,
but I'm just a spectator.
RACHEL
You help him plenty. Believe me.
They watch him rip into another pitch.
RICKEY
Is he able to get things off his
chest? So he doesn't burn up?
RACHEL
Yes. I have to let him have that
silence at first, let him come to
me. But he opens up eventually.
RICKEY
Good. It's too much to carry
inside. Does he have any friends
on the team?
(she gives him a look)
They're spectators, too. They do
admire him though.
Rachel looks out to where Reese and Stanky play catch.
RACHEL
Do you think so?
RICKEY
Even the worst of us recognizes
courage. Moral courage especially.
I have to think they see it.
Jackie's a man on trial. He's
responding with glory and grace.
No one can take their eyes off him.
RACHEL
He's had himself on trial since the
day I met him. No man is harder on
himself or gets to himself worse
than Jack. But I hope his team-
mates know, they're on trial too.
RICKEY
I suppose we all are. You're an
astute woman, Mrs. Robinson.
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 95.
