This man does not. He stands bare chested in his boxers
staring out the window of a MCALPIN HOTEL ROOM. Considering
the world before him. Wondering where his place is in it.
INSERT: April 15, 1947. 3 AM.
It's a lonely moment. Until Rachel appears behind him in her

I love you...
As he closes his eyes, absorbs it...

Jack cruises down, stops in front of the PEPTO BISMOL.

As he grabs a bottle -- a man on the other side pulls one out
as well. Jack finds himself looking at Pee Wee Reese.
JUMP AHEAD TO:
103 EXT. SINGER'S DRUG STORE - BROOKLYN - DAY 103
Jack and Reese exit together, each with a bottle of Pepto
Bismol in hand. Reese hefts his bottle.
REESE
Opening day nerves. Doing my
stomach something awful.
Jack nods in commiseration. It's awkward between them. A
RUMBLE as a GARBAGE TRUCK goes by.
REESE
There goes another one.
(SMILES)
Every time I see a garbage truck go
by I still can't figure why the guy
driving isn't me.
JACK

We'd both better get on base.
Reese nods. They start walking toward the stadium.
TAN REV 6-25-12 68.
REESE
Know when I first heard of you?
JACK
No I don't.
REESE
On a troop transport, coming back
from Guam. A sailor heard it on
the radio, told me the Dodgers had
signed a Negro player. I said that
was fine by me. Then he said the
guy was a shortstop. Least you
were then. That got me thinking.
Thinking gets me scared.
Jack smiles, hefts his bottle of Pepto.
JACK
Black, white, we're both pink
today, huh?
(REESE NODS)
You still scared, Pee Wee?
REESE

Of garbage trucks? Terrified.

Some guys quiet, some guys joking around. Everyone in some
version of getting out of their street clothes or into their
uniforms. The entire operation comes to a halt as --
Jack enters. As he walks past -- some players nod hello.
Others look like Sphinxes. Walker turns and faces his
locker. Gene Hermanski and Branca step over to SHAKE HANDS.
HERMANSKI
I'm Hermanski. Welcome to Brooklyn.

Hey, man. Ralph Branca.

clubhouse manager, steps over.
WHITE 3-14-12 69.
BABE
You're looking for your locker,

They walk over to a hook on the wall. A uniform hangs from
it. A FOLDING CHAIR below.
BABE (CONT'D)
I just got the word. Best I could
do. I'll get you straightened out
tomorrow though, huh?
Jack nods, unbuttoning his shirt... Stanky is suddenly there.
All pugnacity as he gives up 4 inches and 40 pounds to Jack.
STANKY
You're putting on that uniform, it
means you're on my team. But before
I play with you I want you to know
how I feel about it. I want you to
know I don't like it. I want you
to know I don't like you.

That's fine. That's how I prefer

Headed toward the plate for his

Walks toward the plate. More cheers. Mostly.

We're with you, Jackie!

Hey, boy, how about a shine?!
Jack struggles not to look back at the source of the jeer.
He settles in at the plate. JOHNNY SAIN on the mound waiting
for the sign. The crowd BUZZING.
BARBER'S VOICE
Sain looking in. When he's got
that fastball working, he can toss
a lamb chop past a hungry wolf.
The BRAVES CATCHER signals â1'. Here come the pitch. CRACK!
It's down the third base line.
The THIRD BASEMAN is going to need every ounce of his arm as
he fields it at the line, throw across his body to --

RICKEY
Baseball has returned to Brooklyn,
Burt. Another season is underway.
SHOTTON
Yeah, it's a shame about Leo.
RICKEY
Inevitable I suppose. I asked him
if she was worth it and he said
yes. How's the retirement?
SHOTTON
It's fine. The roses --
RICKEY
It's a helluva thing when a man has
good health and enough money and
absolutely nothing to do.
SHOTTON
I'm perfectly happy.
RICKEY
Is that so?
SHOTTON
When I took off that Cleveland
uniform two years ago, I promised
the Mrs. I'd never put on another
uniform again. Roses look great
and I sleep a whole lot better.
RICKEY
Roses and sleep are two wonderful
things, Burt. But sleep you can
get inside your casket and flowers
look good on top of it. You don't
look like a dead man to me.
SHOTTON
What's this about, Branch?
TAN REV 6-25-12 73A.

No, I'm sorry, but no.
RICKEY
Do you miss the game, Burt? Look
me in the eye and tell me you
don't.
Shotton considers Rickey a beat and then looks away.
SHOTTON
Baseball's the only life for an old
pepper pot like me, but I promised
my wife, Branch.
RICKEY
You promised her you wouldn't put
on another uniform. You didn't
promise her you wouldn't manage.
Wear a suit and tie; Connie Mack
still does.

You remember how to get to the Polo

SHOTTON
Branch, I --
RICKEY
You remember what the peanuts smell
like roasting, how the crack of the

JACK
I'm not complaining, I just, I

RACHEL

They want to see if Jackie Robinson
is real. They want to see your

they'll see it in themselves.
He's stopped short. She blinks with mock coquettish modesty.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
And me? I'm just young and scared

He grins at her, almost gets a forkful in when LAWSON BOWMAN,

inside. Jack hits the deck to keep from getting beaned.

Bojangles! You sure can dance,

STANKY
On first, mouth hanging open. Almost forgets to take a lead.
It's an instant Rorschach test.

CHAPMAN
You like white girls?! Huh?!
Which one of them Dodger boys'
wives are you climbing on tonight?!
Chapman looks toward...
DODGER DUGOUT
They don't like that one.
CHAPMAN (CONT'D)
Oh, I think I got it. Dixie, I

JACK
Grips the bat. Watches for the next pitch with bloody
mindedness. He hacks at it, lofts a routine fly into left.
He's about halfway down to first when the left fielder
catches it and Jack can mercifully return to the dugout.

Rickey watches as he disappears inside. Finally exhales.
128 BENCH 128
Jack sits down. No one says anything to him. No one comes
near him as he stares ahead, trapped in a kind of void. The
closest player to him is Bobby Bragan. Bragan finally
manages to glance over at him, then looks quickly away.

As the Dodgers take the field, Jack heads to first. Almost
wincing, wondering if it's going to start again.

JACK
Waiting for the pitch. Takes a mighty swing -- CRACKS a
towering POP-UP between home plate and the mound. Dutch
watches his catcher Seminick settle under it. Waiting.
DUTCH
Hey, is that a home run!?
SEMINICK
Yeah! If you're playing in an
elevator shaft!
Jack veers off the first baseline. Heads for the dugout.
CHAPMAN
You don't belong! Look in a mirror!
This is a white man's game. Get it
through your thick monkey skull!
Jack stops short looks at him. Chapman stands his ground.

Stands, watches. Praying this doesn't go south. As Jack
finally continues on, Rickey closes his eyes in relief.
RACHEL
Sick for her husband.
WHITE 3-14-12 79.
THE DUGOUT
Jack stalks down past the team. No one looks at him. Bragan
is ashamed. Dixie tries to look disinterested. Stanky and
Reese exchange a helpless glance as Jack continues into:
132 THE TUNNEL 132
Like a bull on his way to slaughter, he revolts. WHAM-WHAM!
He proceeds to turn his bat into SPLINTERS. Concrete chips,
wood flies. Jack drops the handle of the bat, pounds his
fists. Heaving for breath, framed by the empty tunnel. Raw,
electric, ungovernable. All the anger on display, the fury.
FEET SCRAPE. Jack looks up to see Rickey standing there,
watching, afraid to get too much closer.
JACK
To hell with this. The next white
son of a bitch who opens his mouth,
I'll smash his goddamn teeth in.
Rickey stands there until finally, opening his mouth...
RICKEY
You can't, Jackie. You know it.

I'm supposed to let this go on?
RICKEY
These men have to live with

JACK
I have to live with myself, too!
And right now I'm living a sermon

Jack is at the end of his rope. All Rickey has are words.
RICKEY
You don't matter right now, Jack.
You're in this thing. You don't
have the right to pull out from the
backing of people who believe in
you, respect you and who need you.
JACK
Is that so?
RICKEY
If you fight, they won't say
Chapman forced you to; they'll just
say that you're over your head.
That you belong where you are.

No. You do. You're the one living

Forty days. All of it. Only you.

And not a damn thing I can do about
it.
