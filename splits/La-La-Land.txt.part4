LAURA
I'm not gonna be hovering anymore.
SEBASTIAN
...You still think New York?
LAURA
I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know,
it's exciting...
Sebastian smiles again. Some calls from the distance --
Revision                     67.
LAURA (CONT'D)
Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws...
She lights up. Likes the sound of that.
LAURA (CONT'D)
Is my...my hair...?
Sebastian, without a word, pulls a strand back. Laura smiles,
kisses him on the cheek. A quiet, tender moment. Then she
hurries off. Sebastian stands there. Watches...
WE FADE OUT.
118   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING
RINGING. Sebastian is awoken. Groaning, he rolls over. Lets
the phone ring. It keeps going. Endless... Finally, fed up, he
reaches for it. Answers --
SEBASTIAN
What...?
WOMAN #2 (O.S.)
Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan.
Sebastian is taken aback. He goes to hang up, saying just --
SEBASTIAN
Wrong number.
WOMAN #2 (O.S.)
-- She's not answering her cell and I was
told I might find her here.
Sebastian pauses. Hurt by the mere mention of Mia's name --
SEBASTIAN
Yeah, well...not anymore.
WOMAN #2 (O.S.)
Ok. If you do talk to her --
SEBASTIAN
I won't.
WOMAN #2 (O.S.)
-- please tell her Jane at Amy Brandt
Casting is trying to reach her.
A beat. Sebastian sits up. Suddenly wide-eyed.
SEBASTIAN
"Casting"...?
Revision                      68.
119   INT. MIA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Dinner has just finished. Mia's Mom gives her a kiss --
MIA'S MOM                            MIA
Night, sweetie.                 Night, Mom.
-- and heads off, as Mia and her Dad stay behind. Getting up
to scrape the dish --
MIA'S DAD
You want some more rice?
MIA
I'm ok.
MIA'S DAD
You look hungry.
MIA
I'm good...
A moment. Mia's Dad puts a few more dishes away, then sits
back down across from her.
MIA'S DAD
It's fun having you back. Your mom
ditches me at ten.
Mia laughs. A moment.
MIA
You took down the swing.
MIA'S DAD
She made me.
A smile.
MIA'S DAD (CONT'D)
I've still got all your old tapes.
MIA
Oh God. Throw those away.
MIA'S DAD
Never.
Just then -- a loud, persistent HONK. Mia's Dad looks up,
eyebrow raised. Mia turns, hearing it as well. The HONKING
is nearby -- just outside...
Mia's thoughts suddenly sharpen. Ears perk up. She's heard the
honking before:
Revision                         69.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT.
MIA'S DAD (CONT'D)
What the hell...?
Disbelief on Mia's face. It can't be. She heads to the nearest
window. There -- at the corner, smack-dab in front of her
house -- is SEBASTIAN'S CAR.
A NEIGHBOR angrily yells at him. Sebastian sees Mia. They lock
eyes. And on that --
120   EXT. MIA'S HOME / SEBASTIAN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Mia and Sebastian stand next to his car.
MIA
Why did you come here?
SEBASTIAN
Because I have good news.
MIA
Ok...
SEBASTIAN
Amy Brandt. The casting director.
MIA
I know who she is.
SEBASTIAN
She was at your play. And she loved it.
And she loved it so much that she wants
you to come audition for a huge movie
she's got.
He's brimming over with excitement. But Mia just shakes
her head.
MIA
I'm not going.
SEBASTIAN
...Excuse me?
MIA
I'm -- no... That will kill me.
SEBASTIAN
That's it?
MIA
Yes.
Revision                    70.
SEBASTIAN
So you're happy here?
MIA
I'm happier.
SEBASTIAN
Why won't you come?
MIA
I told you.
SEBASTIAN
I don't buy it.
MIA
(finally letting it out, fed up --)
Because it's another audition!
(a beat; then --)
I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do
you want to know what happens? Either
they interrupt me because someone ordered
a sandwich, or they cut me off after two
seconds, or I'm crying and they start
laughing, or I'm one of a hundred
lookalikes in the waiting room who never
has a chance, because --
(beat)
-- because --
SEBASTIAN
Because what?
MIA
Because I'm probably not good enough.
SEBASTIAN
Yes you are.
MIA
No. Maybe I'm not.
A beat.
MIA (CONT'D)
Maybe I'm one of those people who's
always wanted to do it but never had a
chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's
like you said. Maybe I need to grow up.
She hesitates. Continues --
Revision                         71.
MIA (CONT'D)
I can go back to school. I can find
something else that I'm supposed to do. I
left school to give it a shot, and it
didn't work out, and it took six years,
and I don't want to do it anymore.
Beat. But Sebastian isn't giving up.
SEBASTIAN
Why?
MIA
Why what?
SEBASTIAN
Why don't you want to do it anymore?
Mia thinks about this one for a moment.
MIA
...Because it hurts a little bit too
much.
Sebastian shakes his head. Nope. Won't accept this.
SEBASTIAN
I told them you'd be there at five-thirty
tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I
drive back at eight. Either you'll be
outside or you won't.
With that, he gets back into his car. Mia is silent. Then --
MIA
How did you find me?
Sebastian turns. Points. Matter-of-fact --
SEBASTIAN
The house across from the library.
He drives off. Mia looks up. There, sure enough, is the
LIBRARY, crouched on the corner. The library that once
helped set her on her path to acting.
She looks at it. Thinks...
121   EXT. MIA'S STREET - NIGHT/DAY
Wide on the street. All is quiet. Night becomes morning...
Revision                         72.
122   EXT. MIA'S HOME - DAY
Sebastian's car pulls over. He sits there. Sips a coffee, a
second coffee in the holder. The time: 8:02.
A moment passes. He taps the wheel. Looks at the house. The
front door remains closed. No Mia. He leans back. Seems
worried. Closes his eyes, breathes out. We MOVE CLOSE on him.
He breathes in and out again...
He opens his eyes. 8:10. The door's still closed. Resigned,
he starts his car up, BEGINS TO PULL AWAY, when --
-- BAM! A KNOCK on the opposite window. He jumps.
It's Mia. She's just arrived at the car from the other side,
two just-bought cups of coffee and a bag of pastries in her
hands. A beat. Sebastian smiles. Then OPENS the door for her.
123   OMIT
124   EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIO LOT - DAY
A cloudy late afternoon. Mia and Sebastian slowly walk
through the lot together. They pass the New York street, the
murals and posters of classic Hollywood, the old Art Deco
ornaments and the big soundstages and backdrops. Neither says
a word...
125   INT. WAITING LOBBY - DAY
Mia and Sebastian are seated. Waiting. The DOOR opens. An
ACTRESS exits. A second later --
ASSISTANT #2
Mia?
Mia gathers her nerves. Gets up. And steps in.
126   INT. AUDITION ROOM / INT. LOBBY - DAY
In the room is AMY BRANDT -- mid-forties. Seated behind her
is the director, FRANK.
AMY BRANDT                       MIA
Hi, Mia.                        Hi.
AMY BRANDT
I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you.
Mia nods. Smiles. A moment.
AMY BRANDT (CONT'D)
The movie shoots in Paris. There's no script.
Revision                        73.
FRANK
We want to build the character with you.
It's a process. Three-month rehearsal,
four-month shoot.
MIA
...Ok.
AMY BRANDT
So why don't you just tell us a story?
MIA
...About...?
AMY BRANDT
About anything.
Mia nods again. A moment.
AMY BRANDT (CONT'D)
Whenever you're ready.
Mia thinks. She takes a breath -- then goes silent again. It
seems she might be unsure what to do, might even be about to
choke the audition. We fear she may botch this completely...
A126   WE CUT TO THE LOBBY -- to Sebastian, hearing Mia's silence. On
edge... Worried...
B126   WE RETURN to the AUDITION ROOM... Brandt and Frank waiting...
MIA
My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She
used to tell me these stories, when I was
growing up, about living abroad...
(beat)
I remember -- she told me she jumped into
the Seine once...
She pauses, and then continues -- in SONG. [TRACK: AUDITION]
Yes, this audition is different than the rest, and the switch
to song signals just that. Mia's nerves fade away -- all the
accents and fakery of earlier auditions a distant memory. This
is Mia undisguised -- pure and stark and beautiful...
She uses the story of her aunt jumping into the river to
paint a portrait of all the dreamers in the world -- all the
people who are told they're nuts for pursuing their passion --
all the so-called "fools" who take the plunge. She sings
about them and for them. This is why Mia does what she does --
why she simply has no choice...
The song ends, and we linger on her for a moment. Then...
Revision                     74.
...WE DISSOLVE TO:
127   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY
Mia and Sebastian sit on a bench, the Observatory perched
behind them. The clouds have parted, and it's now a gorgeous
Los Angeles afternoon, minutes before dusk.
Sebastian looks at Mia. A moment passes.
SEBASTIAN
When do you find out?
MIA
They said the next couple of days... But
I'm not expecting to find anything out.
SEBASTIAN
You're going to get it.
MIA
No, I'm not.
SEBASTIAN
You are. I know these things.
A beat.
MIA
Where are we?
Sebastian looks at her.
SEBASTIAN
Griffith Park.
MIA
I mean -- where are we?
SEBASTIAN
I know...
(beat)
I don't know.
MIA
What do we do?
SEBASTIAN
I don't think we can do anything. Because
when you get this --
MIA
If I get this --
Revision                           75.
SEBASTIAN
When you get this -- you've got to give
it everything you've got.
Beat.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
It's your dream.
MIA
What are you going to do?
SEBASTIAN
I've got to follow my own plan. Stay
here. Get my own thing going. You know...
A moment. Mia nods. Sebastian looks at her again.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz
there. And you love jazz now.
Mia smiles.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Right?
MIA
Right.
Another moment. And then, finally --
SEBASTIAN
I guess we're just going to have to wait
and see.
Mia's eyes well up, just slightly, as she hears this. She
nods.
MIA
You know I'm always going to love you.
SEBASTIAN
I'm always going to love you too.
Beat. Sebastian looks up at the Observatory.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Look at this view.
MIA
(playfully)
I've seen better.
Revision                         76.
SEBASTIAN
Agreed.
They laugh.
Then, almost to herself --
MIA
I've never been here during the day.
Sebastian smiles. A moment.
We CUT TO WIDE. Sebastian and Mia sit side by side. We linger
here, our two characters framed by the white-and-green
Observatory, the rest of L.A. stretching out beyond.
And then, ever so slowly...
...we FADE TO:
WINTER
A palm tree, a cloudless sky. We PULL BACK -- to reveal it's
all painted...
128   EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
We're on a studio lot, looking at one of the old painted
backdrops, of a palm tree and sky. A new title card:
Five years later...
We TILT down to the studio's entryway. A CAR enters.
A WOMAN steps out. We don't see her face. We FOLLOW her from
behind. She walks elegantly, poised. The wind picks up a
strand of her hair. She makes her way down side-streets we've
seen before, past Parisian-style façades. Then enters a
COFFEE SHOP we recognize...
129   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
The eyes inside all look the WOMAN's way. She reaches the
counter -- and we finally SEE HER FACE:
MIA
Hi... Iced coffee, please.
MIA looks different. Different haircut, different way of
handling herself.
The BARISTA hurries to get Mia's order. We recognize this as
the shop where Mia used to work. A man who appears to be the
NEW MANAGER gives Mia the coffee --
Revision                      77.
NEW MANAGER
On us.
MIA
No, no, that's fine.
Mia hands over a few dollar bills. Then drops another bill into
the tip jar. The Barista smiles.
130   EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
Mia exits the coffee shop...and is met by a CREW MEMBER on a
GOLF CART. She gets on the cart -- and is driven away...
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON hands on piano keys, fluttering across the ivories.
We PULL BACK: it's SEBASTIAN. We're in...
131   INT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY
...a small jazz club. Simple, tasteful, cool. Stone arches in
1940's style. The seats close to the band, the piano in the
center. The club has the same old-school character as the
Lighthouse -- but it's not run-down. It's polished, inviting.
The place is empty save for Sebastian and an EMPLOYEE. It's
before-hours. Sebastian finishes playing. Feels out the
lowest keys once more, then the highest. Then turns and --
SEBASTIAN
Alright, I'm done.
(gets up)
Harris did a nice job with it.
EMPLOYEE
Took him long enough.
Sebastian smiles.
SEBASTIAN
No one touches the instruments. Carson's
coming an hour early to test levels.
EMPLOYEE
I got a check for you to sign.
SEBASTIAN
How'd we do last month?
EMPLOYEE
Not too bad.
Revision                          78.
SEBASTIAN
(as he signs the check)
Not too bad is great.
(taps the Employee on the
shoulder)
See you tonight.
EMPLOYEE
See you tonight.
132   EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY
Mia pulls into the driveway.
133   INT. ROOM - CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY
She steps inside. Flowers and cards. We glimpse cursive
"CONGRATULATIONS" written on a few of them. A stack of scripts
on a nearby table. Her name visible. She drops her things,
spots someone, goes in to kiss him. A long, tender, loving
embrace, as we pull back...
...and see that it's not Sebastian.
It's a MAN we haven't seen before: DAVID, mid-thirties. He
and Mia kiss again. And, running over and grabbing Mia's leg,
is a TWO-YEAR-OLD GIRL...
134   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING
Sebastian steps in. The place is more habitable than his old
digs. Fully furnished, warm and welcoming. He heads to the
kitchen, pulls out some pork cutlets he's been thawing. We see,
sitting on the counter, a Christmas card with a photo attached:
Laura, Harry, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY, all gathered on a couch
and smiling at the camera.
135   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER
Sebastian eats his meal, in a new shirt and pants. Checks
his watch.
136   EXT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY
Sebastian pulls up outside the club. New car, same style.
Gets out and passes by a movie poster as he walks. We
can't see the title, but we can catch a glimpse of a face
on it.
It's MIA...
137   INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
We're back in the club.
Revision                       79.
It's bustling now -- the BARTENDERS setting up, DOORMEN
coming in, MUSICIANS sound-checking. Sebastian enters, the
musicians greet him --
DRUMMER
King Seb!
SEBASTIAN
Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?
DRUMMER
Like the desert misses the rain.
And then -- we see a SAXOPHONIST we recognize. One of the old
Lighthouse players.
SAXOPHONIST
Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight.
SEBASTIAN
Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh?
SAXOPHONIST
That's not Edgar.
Laughs, pats on the back.
138   INT. ROOM - CHATEAU MARMONT - NIGHT
Mia, in a new outfit, crosses the living area and grabs her
purse and jacket. David is by the door, jacket on as well.
Mia bends back around a sofa, where the GIRL we saw before is
seated next to a nineteen-year-old baby-sitter, CHELSEA.
MIA
Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea.
The Girl nods. Mia kisses her forehead. Heads to the door.
CHELSEA
Bye, Mrs. Dolan.
139   OMIT
140   INT. CAR - NIGHT
David drives, Mia seated beside him. They're on the 101.
Gridlock traffic up ahead.
DAVID
What if we miss this? What do we tell
Natalie?
Revision                      80.
MIA
We can just see it back in New York...
David nods. Looks at the time on the car. 8:06.
141   INT. CAR - LATER
Mia and David are seated. Still not moving. Mia looks at the
clock again: 8:27.
MIA (CONT'D)
Do you want to just skip it...? Turn off
here and get dinner?
David looks at her. Smiles.
DAVID
Alright...
142   EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
Mia and David walk down a street. A few open restaurants and
bars, a few other closed storefronts. A lot of old, weathered
buildings: 1930's stucco, Art Deco signs.
Then -- David's ears perk up. He hears something. MUSIC...
He looks around. Doesn't see the source. Heads to the end of
the block, then sees, just up ahead, a few people entering a
building. Seems to be where the music's coming from...
Mia heads over, curious. The music grows louder -- sounds like
a JAZZ COMBO. Mia peeks toward the door...
...and then FREEZES.
The sign on the door reads: "SEB'S". It's written the way she
drew it for Sebastian, years ago...
Coming up to her side, oblivious --
DAVID (CONT'D)
This looks fun.
David edges past Mia. Glimpses the bar inside. Turns to her,
inviting --
DAVID (CONT'D)
Come on...
Mia doesn't know what to say. She follows David...
Revision                          81.
143   INT. JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS
Inside, a JAZZ COMBO is tearing through a fast bop chart. The
seats around the band are almost all occupied. Young fans,
older couples, passersby trickling in from outside. It's an
excited crowd, far more varied than what we saw at the
Lighthouse -- a real range of ages and styles.
Mia's eyes drift as David heads to the bar. She recognizes the
images on the walls -- all Sebastian's. Recognizes a stool by
the bar -- also Sebastian's, formerly Hoagy Carmichael's...
DAVID (CONT'D)
Mia?
She turns to David. Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows
him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the
bandstand...
The combo finishes. Hearty applause. A young PIANIST rises
from the keys, waves "thanks".
And -- just then -- Sebastian appears. Mia looks at him,
frozen.
SEBASTIAN
(taking the microphone)
Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen.
(more applause)
I don't know, I told him to play "Jingle
Bells".
The crowd laughs. Sebastian smiles, looks at them --
-- and sees Mia.
Shock. The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first
time they've seen each other in years.
A prolonged silence. Sebastian is speechless.
Then -- forcing himself to keep on a face --
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Welcome to Seb's.
More applause. Sebastian sits at the piano. Looks at the keys.
He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at
Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow
musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys --
-- and finally starts playing.
Revision                         82.
A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A
melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize...
It's Mia and Sebastian's song.
Mia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys.
This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. The
most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded.
We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It
recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT
that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian
plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at
first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in
perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon...
144   ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT... Back when
Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time...
Within this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece.
We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. All is
as before, as we remember it... And sure enough, Mia
approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and --
MIA
I just wanted to say -- I saw your
playing, and I --
-- but instead of brushing past her --
-- Sebastian decks her with a kiss for the ages.
A BURST OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. The DINERS in the restaurant spin
around to face Mia and Sebastian -- and SNAP their fingers in
time. Even the Boss starts to DANCE. Mia and Sebastian grin --
and then strut out together, hand in hand... [EPILOGUE]
145   INT. NEW APARTMENT - DAY
Mia and Sebastian push open a new door -- to their new place.
It's a shabby one-bedroom -- but it's theirs...
146   INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT
Next, Keith approaches Sebastian at the Lighthouse -- but
Sebastian immediately shakes his head "no".
147   INT. THEATER - NIGHT
Sebastian watches Mia perform -- it's the night of her play.
He stands up to applaud -- and behind him, the entire
theater, utterly packed, rises as well. A huge standing
ovation. Mia's ROOMMATES are there, giddy with joy, as are
LAURA and HARRY...
Revision                          83.
148      INT. STUDIO SOUNDSTAGE - DAY / NIGHT
Mia and Sebastian walk together outside -- but now that we're
outside we realize this isn't the real L.A. at all..
This, in fact, is an L.A. that doesn't exist. A painted-
backdrop L.A., just like the one we saw Mia pass by when
parking on the lot...
The old orange groves and the g
