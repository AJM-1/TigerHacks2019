Jason follows Gabriella down below, the VOICES on the deck
fading.
DINA (O.S.)
Why bother insuring it? Let's drink
it instead.

28 INT. BOAT - DAY
It's quiet inside, not tasteful but impressive, like
everything else of the Reeses. Jason takes a stab at
conversation.
JASON
Big boat.
Gabriella laughs and looks over her shoulder at him.
They're both kids.
GABRIELLA
ugly, isn't it.
He grins and relaxes, looks around.
JASON
The fittings are definitely -- yeah
on the ugly side. But damn, she's
solid.
GABRIELLA
Oh, a boat type.
JASON
(proud, defensive)
I like.boats.
Gabriella shows him the climatized, built-in wine closet
next to the galley. He starts to rack the bottles while
she watches. He talks to stop her from leaving.
JASON
So where you headed?
GABRIELLA
I'm not going, 'I can't go.
JASON
They don't want to take the baby.
GABRIELLA
Iâ¢don't have a green card, I can't
leave the country. Baby goes with
an American nurse. I house-sit.
It's fine.
JASON
You don't like them.
Gabriella laughs.

GABRIELLA
God. I'm obvious. I just don't
like working for people, but that's
life.
He chafes under authority the same way she does.
JASON
Doesn't have to be.
GABRIELLA
Maybe not with a rich stepfather.
He laughs.
JASON
Worst kind.
GABRIELLA
(CORRECTIVELY)
No.
(A BEAT)
You don't appreciate what you have,
Jason. It's very poor where I came
from.
JASON
Where's that?
GABRIELLA
Venezuela. Do I look it?
JASON
I don't know, I never been there.
GABRIELLA
Well, I don't. My mother's Indian.
The India kind of Indian.
(LAUGHS)
Imagine a house where the father
asks 'What's for dinner' in Spanish,
and the mother answers 'Curry' in
Hindi. 'Que hay para cenar' she
says, 'Murgee, masala, ghaal.' He
says, 'No es importante.' No wonder
I'm nuts.
JASON
You don't seem too nuts.
She laughs.
GABRIELLA

29 EXT. BOAT, THE DECK - DAY
The agent is putting a magnificent diamond necklace in a
velvet pouch that he fastidiously cinches and ties.
Alex looks away from it to take a bottle out of the
remaining case on deck.
AGENT
-- so back to the safe it goes --
Dina lifts up the baby and smells its bottom.
FRANK
Dina, that's disgusting.
DINA
The alternative is using your
fingers, Frank. which offends you
more?
Alex laughs. Frank pushes back his chair.
FRANK
Don't encourage her, Alex. Her
mouth is big enough.
Dina is hurt.
FRANK
(to the agent)
I'll show you that painting in our
stateroom.
The agent follows him away.
ALEX
(kindly; to Dina)
Do you want to see the label?
She hides her hurt by not looking at him.
DINA
Just open the bottle, Alex. Pour us
both a glass. I'm not allowed to
drink alone.
When she turns her head and looks at him, she's flirting.

30 INT. BOAT - DAY
Jason has almost finished storing the wine. Gabriella is
sitting on a bar stool at the galley,. listening to him,
snared by the quiet passion in his voice.
JASON
-- when you're skimming along the
water, nothing between you and the
bottom of the sea but a layer of
wood, your thoughts... end. All
that noise inside your head?
Gabriella nods, understanding exactly.
JASON
. . . Stops.
Dina's VOICE booms over the INTERCOM, startling both of
them. The BABY is FUSSING. Gabriella makes a gesture of
apology to Jason.
DINA (V.O.)
Gabriella? Are you down there?
GABRIELLA
Yes, Mrs. Reese.
DINA (V.0.)
The baby needs you. And bring a
pacifier for Frank.
GABRIELLA
Right there.
She slides off the stool.
JASON
You should come out with me
sometime.
She smiles without answering and goes topside. His eyes
follow her. A Deckhand comes down the ladder with the
remaining case of wine for him to stock.
31 EXT. BOAT - DAY 31
Gabriella. lifts the fussy baby from Dina, her hands sure
and calming. She coos nonsense to his little ear as she-
reaches for the diaper bag and slings it over her arm.
GABRIELLA

Frank and the agent return from another section of the
boat.
FRANK
You doing up to the house,
Gabriella?
(off her nod)
Want to take this with you?
He sweeps the policies into a large manila envelope, drops
the 'pouch in with them, ties the string, hands it to her.
FRANK
Put it on my desk.
He looks at his wife with her glass, Alex with his glass,
and doesn't like it. His voice hardens slightly.
FRANK
Are we all set, Alex?
ALEX
I'm going to check the storage room,
see what else'll travel. I know I
put some vintage Armagnac in there,
maybe some Porto?
He heads down the gangplank.
FRANK
He's a vendor, Dina. It's like
drinking with the help.
DINA
(DISARMING HIM)
Did you pick the wine, sweetie?
It's lovely.
Frank grins, pleased. His hand curves around her
shoulder. He has forgotten about the other vendor
present, the agent.
AGENT
(AWKWARDLY)
So I'll messenger over the rider for
your signature --
Frank laughs out loud, in a better mood:
FRANK
-- You still here?
Dina laughs, too.

32 INT. VILLA, UPSTAIRS - DAY
Gabriella settles the baby on his side, the only Reese she
likes. She starts to close the shutters. Lullaby MUSIC
is playing on the baby's TAPE DECK.
IN THE HALLWAY
She closes the nursery door as softly as possible. A
man's hands go around her throat. Her gasp dies
stillborn. It's Alex, kissing her.ear, holding Dina's
diamond necklace to her neck.
ALEX
(MURMURING)
Did he ever come on to you?
GABRIELLA
(ANGRY)
Don't sneak up on me that way!
ALEX
Look how beautiful you are. He's an
idiot if he didn't.
Now she sees the necklace.
GABRIELLA
What are you doing?
She snatches the necklace away from him and fairly runs
down the hall to Frank's study.
IN THE STUDY
She tries td stuff it in the pouch. Alex is right behind
her.
GABRIELLA
You're going to get me fired and
deported.
ALEX
Just put it on for a minute. Look
at yourself.
She slaps at his hands half-heartedly, but it's so
tempting.
ALEX
See what you deserve.
GABRIELLA
(SUCCUMBING)
We're both crazy.

Alex moves her hair away. She lets him hook the necklace
around her neck. He reaches over to open the closet door,
fitted out now as a file cabinet, but with the original
closet mirror still in place. The safe is visible.
Gabriella stares at her reflection, Alex behind her,
watching her. The necklace changes her posture. She
angles her chin slightly, twists back her hair. Diamonds
suit her.
GABRIELLA
(TITILLATED)
It's vulgar.
ALEX
into her ear)
Not against your skin.
He starts to pleat her T-shirt loose from her jeans. She
doesn't resist. They watch each other in the mirror.
JASON (O.S.)
-- Alex? They're waiting for you!
Alex blows out a frustrated breath.
ALEX
Ah... shit...
He hurriedly unhooks the necklace and puts it back in the
pouch, gathers up the insurance papers and Polaroids that
had spilled and slides them back in the envelope with the
pouch.' Gabriella is tucking in her T-shirt. She closes
the closet door.
Jason's VOICE is closer, more impatient, at the bottom of
the stairs.
JASON (O.S.)
Alex!
33 INT. VILLA, STAIRCASE - DAY 33
Alex appears at the top of the stairs, surprising Jason.
ALEX
I was in the bathroom.
He walks down the stairs. A wooden case of liquor is by

Give me a hand, will you? I'm not
as young as you are.

He goes out the door ahead of Jason, leaving him to carry

she walks away down the hall.
RESUME SCENE
His face tightens. He follows Alex.
34 INT. RESTAURANT BACK ROOM - NIGHT 34
A poker game is breaking up. Five players, Alex among
them. He's done all right. DAVE -- an older man -- has
lost. He tosses down his cards.
DAVE
I'm out, I'm home.
ALEX
(SYMPATHETICALLY)
You play for the possibilities,
Dave. So do I. Or else why get up
in the morning.
VICTOR SPANSKY neatly stacks his modest winnings. He's
tall, thick-shouldered, 55, with a gray crew-cut, tinted
glasses, and a smoker's cough. He does nothing in a
hurry.
VICTOR
(TO DAVE)
You didn't lose that much.
ALEX
There's an optimist in every game.
DAVE
(PISSED)
Alex, I don't appreciate --
ALEX
(overriding htm,
UNRUFFLING HIM)
No, I'm saying... the guy who
sits down at the table with a
loser's attitude... loses even if he
wins -- which he won't. He's got no

DAVE
Good night.
They all AD-LIB "Good night," "See you next week," etc.,
as they file out. Alex and Victor are the last in the
room. Alex puts on his jacket.
VICTOR
Paltry pickings tonight.
Alex looks at the small amount of cash on the table.
ALEX
You want to cut for what's here.
Victor chuckles..
VICTOR
Sure. Why not.
He pushes his cash forward into a pot with Alex's. Alex
fans the deck across the table.
ALEX
(CONVERSATIONALLY)
What-are you doing with your life,
Victor?.
Victor makes a small gesture, indicating the cards.
VICTOR
This, more or less.
He pulls a card -- he has good hands -- and turns it up.
A king of spades. A smile tugs at his mouth.
VICTOR
Beat that.
Alex produces the Polaroid of Dina's necklace from his
inside jacket pocket.

He flicks it on the table next to Victor's king. Victor's
gaze clicks from the photo to Alex, back to the photo. He
slowly reaches out and picks it up.
VICTOR
Very pretty. I remember when it
was the cover of the auction
catalogue. The Duchess of Windsor's
baubles. Bought for a young wife,
I remember. Who I'm sure worked
just as hard as the Duchess.
ALEX
it's appraised at a million three
hundred thousand dollars.

Victor tosses the photo back on the table with
VICTOR
And they say there's no inflation.
ALEX
I have access.
Victor shakes his head no.
VICTOR
I'm retired.
ALEX
And broke.
VICTOR
I don't need that much.
ALEX
Bullshit. You need as much as I do.
Victor's eyes blink behind his glasses.
VICTOR
What kind of access? For
curiosity's sake.
ALEX
I have a friend in the house.

She'd never know, I don't want her
to know... I like her too much.
VICTOR -
I don't trust amateurs, either..
He gets up and walks to the door.
VICTOR
Don't take it personally,. Alex. I
don't trust the phone company,, the
jury system, or the Israeli
government. So why should I trust
you.
ALEX
Because I know a good thing when I
see it.
Alex flips over a card. It's the king of clubs.
ALEX
Victor...
Victor has been distracted by Alex's proposition. Now he
comes back to scoop up his money. Alex sweeps the cards
back into a stack, leaving only the photo on the table.
ALEX
... But this is fifty-fifty..

35 INT. CONDO, JASON'S ROOM - NIGHT

champagne flutes.
ALEX
I saw the light still on. I'm glad
you're up.
SUZANNE
(eyeing the champagne)
What'd you do this time?
He's too pumped to take offense.
ALEX
C'mon, c'mon, be nice.
SUZANNE
Whenever you open champagne -- it's
such a giveaway.
He pours her a glass.
ALEX
I told you I was playing poker
tonight.
He hands her the glass. She takes a sip.
SUZANNE
You know, I've-never actually seen
you play poker -- maybe poker
doesn't even exist. Maybe it's just
a cover story men use.
He laughs.
ALEX
I won.
SUZANNE
Hey; lightning strikes.
He fills his glass.

Let's not get into this, honey.
Her voice is tired.

ALEX "

steady percentage, there may be a
problem with the regulator -- so I'd
better check it right away.

considering.

ALEX

with a month away. That's what I
thought.
AT THE WINE ROOM
DINA
(NEUTRALLY)
A month alone with Frank.
Alex chuckles as he starts to inspect the humidifier.
ALEX
Second honeymoon.
DINA
The first one was bad enough.
She's standing too close to him, but he has no room to
maneuver away. He fiddles with the box.
ALEX
-- It may need a part replaced.
DINA
Nice suit. You always dress well,
Alex.
She brushes the lint off his jacket and leaves her hand
there.

reassembled, but there's a tension and a breathlessness
about them Gabriella recognizes.

Dina spies some interaction between Gabriella and Alex,
and her pretty face hardens.
DINA
Did you leave him by himself?
GABRIELLA
Just to get his sheets.
DINA
That's the maid's job.
