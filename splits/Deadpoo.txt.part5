TRAIN-WRECK, scarred face on display to the world for the
first time.
He looks purposeful, but tentative, walking behind Vanessa,
GAINING on her.
ANGLE ON:   WADE's P.O.V.
A BOY goes by on his bike, trying hard not to gape. A
TODDLER in a STROLLER looks up and BURSTS INTO TEARS. The
toddler's MOTHER hustles past.

MOTHER
Alex, don't stare.
VANESSA stops and rifles through her purse for keys.
STILL on Wade's P.O.V. Wade stops, too, suddenly paralyzed,
as the moment to face Vanessa arrives.
As he hesitates, torn with anguish, the WHISPERS seem to
grow, rising in volume until they become deafening:
WHISPER 2 (O.S.)
Oh, my, god, that is so fucking gnarly.
WHISPER 3 (O.S.)
I just lost my appetite.
Wade spins, trying to see where the voices are coming from.
Nowhere... everywhere. The WHISPERS crescendo, now more in
Wade's mind than in reality.
He turns back to Vanessa, his face a mask of fear and pain...
just as she disappears into her apartment building. The
closing glass door reveals his own HIDEOUS REFLECTION STARING
BACK AT HIM.
DEADPOOL
In the whole wide world, there's nothing
as ugly...
(beat)
...as fear.
He gives up on his mission, backing away from his reflection,
Vanessa, his old life. He stumbles off the curb and into the
street, when... BAM!
He is CRUSHED OUT OF FRAME by a SPEEDING BUS.
SMASH CUT TO

B44    INT.   DEADPOOL'S LAIR - NIGHT                                           B44
An FBI-STYLE `ORGANIZATIONAL CHART' has been pinned on Wade's
CORKBOARD in the lair. A `pyramid' of baddies are linked by
strings. Each baddie is depicted not by a photograph, but a
child-like CRAYON DRAWING.
Second from the top is the RECRUITER.
At the APEX of the pyramid is AJAX HIMSELF.
DEADPOOL, in his LAIR, sews together an early `proto-
costume.'
We see quick cuts of pieces of it going on:
White Adidas track suit. White gloves.            White boots.     And
some sort of white mask...
A single gun, underarm holster, boot knife but no swords.

DEADPOOL
Don't make me ask twice.     Where's
Francis?!
DEADPOOL questions a bleeding thug, more bodies scattered
across a floor littered with broken furniture behind him.
Another thug rushes in and smashes a pool cue over Deadpool's
skull. Deadpool snatches the broken shaft of wood and PUNCHES
it into the thugs belly.
A third thug staggers to his feet, pulls a pistol, fires
multiple shots point blank. Deadpool staggers back, blood
blossoming across his white suit.
"CLICK"
The thug stares in disbelief that Deadpool's still standing.
Deadpool looks down at the shaft of wood in his hand.
Thinks.

DEADPOOL, TIDE STAIN-STICK in hand, tries unsuccessfully to
get the blood out of his white suit.
We get our first glimpse of BLIND AL, who's sitting next to
Deadpool at the laundromat, completely unfazed by the
bloodbath:
BLIND AL
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

look, shrugs)
Or wear red.
Deadpool's eyes light up. He crumples this suit into a ball
and tosses it into a trash bin.

DEADPOOL's at the sewing machine again.
Quick cuts of a RED `proto' outfit going on: Cheap red
sweats. Red gloves. Red converse. As yet unseen RED MASK,
which turns out to be...

In a BOXING RING at the center of the room two WOMEN pound
each other surrounded by a scrum of a CROWD. Deadpool spies
his mark in a dirty white suit pressed in tight ringside.
Deadpool pulls his mask down, wades into the crowd, throwing
men aside, PLOWING toward his target.
The mark sees Deadpool at the last second, turns as a KATANA
flashes out and skewers his hand, pinning it to the wall.
Deadpool fires a couple shots into the ceiling, sending the
rest of the crowd rushing for the exit.

K44/VK44 INT.   RICE WORLD - NIGHT                                    K44/VK44
A wretched room, dirty mattresses covering the floor. Dim
light scatters through a tangle of IV bags hastily strung up
over MEN too poor to have anywhere else to go and die.
The RECRUITER kneels, speaking quietly to a particularly
hardened patient. He places a card in the man's emaciated
hand, then stands and walks toward a low doorway.
The recruiter enters a brightly lit room stacked high with
bags of rice. Two heavily armed THUGS fall in beside him.
The men scan the aisles as they move toward a door leading
out into an alley.

They turn to see DEADPOOL, high atop a stack of rice bags.

One goes down in a bloody heap. Deadpool leaps toward the
other, skewers him with both swords. The thug falls
backward, dead before he hits the ground.

WADE
No... no way! I'm not making her life as

WEASEL
C'mon, you can't look that bad! It's
like that blemish no one notices but you.

44A    INT./EXT.   MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT - PAST                                 44A
A highly pleased DEADPOOL holds up the-soon-to-become-famous
MASK for the first time, ushering in... a MONTAGE:
WADE, at SISTER MARGARET's, receives a YELLOW CARD with a
Cypress Tree from WEASEL.
He turns a LUCHA LIBRE mask INSIDE OUT to reveal the classic
DEADPOOL MASK we all know and love. Puts it on. Then
dresses - piece-by-piece - in the RED UNIFORM we've come to
know and love. And at last, UNSHEATHES A KATANA. The sword
TWIRLS, SLASHES, LUNGES into shadow. A HANDKERCHIEF WIPES
BLOOD from the BLADE. The katana gets SHEATHED again.
The same yellow card is now RECEIVED and PUNCHED by Weasel.
Wade is paid in TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS. WHIP CREAM froths onto
a shot glass. A BLOW-JOB is TOSSED BACK.
Meanwhile, VANESSA plays SKEE-BALL wistfully by herself at
the ARCADE:
SKEE-BALLS roll into HOLES. LIGHTS FLASH. TICKETS CHURN
OUT. VANESSA catches a reflection of someone STARING at her
from across the lobby. When she spins around, the culprit is
GONE. Vanessa SHIVERS... but it's a warm shiver, somehow.
A HEAP of TICKETS slides across the prize counter. A big
STUFFED ANIMAL slides into Vanessa's arms. Vanessa tosses it
into an empty CLOSET inside her and Wade's former APARTMENT.
Then stares out the SPIDER-WEB CRACK in the window.
Back at DEADPOOL's LAIR, Deadpool places various suspicious
accoutrements on the NORNAS COFFEE TABLE: an 8x11 framed
photo of VANESSA. A BOTTLE of JERGENS. A BOX of KLEENEX.
His BELT. His powder-blue CROCS. Deadpool kicks back on the
FUTON. Smiles under his mask.
CUT TO: BLIND AL, building yet another shelving unit,
looking up with a grossed-out frown: `Am I hearing what I
think I'm hearing?'
Next, DEADPOOL finishes plastering hundreds of ADVENT
CALENDARS he's purchased onto one WALL of his LAIR.

When the wall is covered, he carefully pins the FIRST
ornament onto the FIRST tree on the FIRST calendar.
And at last, his MASK comes OFF and his HEAD hits the PILLOW.
Instantly, the montage CRANKS UP its SPEED, with quicker and
quicker EDITS.
The visual totems that have just been introduced begin to FLY
by... shorthand for the passage of time:
Yellow cards are given, received, punched.
Blades are unsheathed, sheathed, cleaned.
Whip cream sprayed.     Drinks consumed.
Skee-balls rolled into holes. Tickets won. Prizes earned.
Tossed onto a EVER-GROWING PILE in the closet. VANESSA
staring out her window.
Jergens pumped. Kleenexes pulled.       Crocs discarded.      BLIND
AL's ears plugged.
Ornaments are pinned to calendars.      Lords a-leap.      Swans a-
swim. Maids a-milk.
Mask comes off.    Head hits pillow.    Mask pulls on.
The images fly by FASTER... FASTER... FASTER.
Whip cream. Skee-balls.     Crocs.    Ornaments.   Weasel.
Deadpool. Vanessa. Al.
`I NEED A HERO' plays faster and faster, too - higher and
higher, like a record on too many RPMs.
The effect is rhythmic... hypnotic...
...until finally, the montage REACHES a CRESCENDO.
And then BOOM!    Ratchets back to REGULAR SPEED:
`CHRISTMAS MORNING' has arrived. All the calendars but one
are now fully studded with decorations. DEADPOOL plucks out
one last STAR to pin atop the final TREE.
Only it's not a star at all, it's AJAX's MUG SHOT clipped out
from the old NEWSPAPER.
With great satisfaction, Deadpool pins the faded photo to the
last treetop. The music dies, and Deadpool turns to camera.

A TAXI - if you've been paying attention, you will recognize

A docile SUPER-SLAVE, fitted with a control collar and cuffs,
steps into a CRATE IDENTICAL to the ONES AJAX DELIVERED TO

ANGEL DUST is overseeing.      She plunges a pistol-grip syringe
into his neck and fires:

The man's eyelids flutter shut. Next to him, four identical
crates hold four unconscious men and women. The workshop
henchmen hammer on the tops and laboriously load them up into

ANGEL picks up one over her shoulder with ease. She turns at
the sound of a sputtering motorcycle getting closer.
Ajax rolls in on one of the battered black bikes from the
freeway. Smoke curls from its broken tailpipe.
He steps off the bike while it's still moving, just letting
it roll forward and tip to the ground with a clank.

Angel doesn't seem surprised by his dirty and bloodied
