NGO
Yep.
He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.
DJANGO
Where's the other two?
BETINA.
They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
for breakin' eggs.
DJANGO
They whippin' Little Jody?
She nods her head, yes.
DJANGO
Point me in that direction.
She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.
BETINA
You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."
DJANGO
Go git that white man, I came here with.
He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him
and The Brittle Brothers.
FLASH ON
A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his
wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his
BULLWHIP.
DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.
3/
DJANGO
Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
She's real sorry!
The WHIP RIPS her back.
DJANGO
(SCREAMING)
Goddamit, Big John!
LITTLE RAJ
Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
Brittle with everything he has.
BACK TO DJANGO
crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.
FLASH ON
Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the
KNEELING DJANGO;
BIG JOHN BRITTLE
I like the way you beg, boy.
EXT - STABLE - DAY
Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen)
to a dead tree stump.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE
Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
are clumsy. You'd break everything in
goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
only known cure for nigger clumsiness
is a peelin'.
Little Jody begs to differ.
BACK TO DJANGO
As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH
BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the
little dogs no nevermind.
3 2-
BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE
In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.
BIG JOHN
After this we'll see if you break eggs again.
DJANGO
turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see
him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...
WHEN ...
.DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;
DJANGO
John Brittle!
Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little
Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
Bulldogs.
LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's
the same thing in the mirror.
LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
DJANGO just stares back.
BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
So does Roger.
LITTLE RAJ
Django?
Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
shake his hand ...
DJANGO
Remember me?
.Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny
bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.
BIG JOHN FACE
goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
heart, at Django.
DJANGO
I like the way you die, boy.
3 3
Big John hears it...then tips over dead.
LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see
it.
LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
It goes off... BANG.
SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
MORE SLAVES gather.
DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
Django, and the two dead bodies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Who are they?
DJANGO
That's John Brittle, and that's his
little brother Raj.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where's Ellis?
DJANGO
He's the one hightailin' it across that
field right now.
Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
to make an escape.
SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER
goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you sure that's him?
Ellis gets further away...
DJANGO
Yes!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you positive?
Ellis gets further away...
DJANGO
I dunno.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't know if you're positive?
Ellis gets further away...
DJANGO
I don't know what, positive,'means.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It means you're sure.
DJANGO
Yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, what?
DJANGO
Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
BAM!
The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
Django does the same with his pistol.
Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!
SPENCER
Just who the hell are you two jokers?
35;
Drï¿½. SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
of the criminal justice system of the
United States of America. The man to my
left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
Roger Brittle --
DJANGO
- They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know them by the name, Shaffer.
But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
These are wanted men. The law wants them
for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
states dead or alive. When Django and myself
executed these men on sight, we were operating
within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
passions are high. But I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force
against a officer of the court in the
performance of his duty is, you will be
hung by the neck until you are dead.
This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
After his dramatic pause for effect...
.Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I please remove the warrant from my
pocket so you may examine it?
Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
paper.
SPENCER
Gimmie.
Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to
what it says.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Satisfied.
Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I have that back?
36
,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.
Dr.SCHULTZ
We good?
BENNETT
Get off my land.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Post haste.
(TO DJANGO)
Load up the bodies as quickly as
you can, and let's get out of
here.
TIME CUT
All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse
the bounty hunters brought with them.
Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man
start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way
for one final threat.
BENNETT
Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
while you on my property. But for lettin' a
nigger kill a white man, and especially for
letting a nigger kill a white man in a
audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
it out of the county alive. Mark my words
Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
from my motherfuckin' gate.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
regulator playmates aren't shy about
killing for what you believe in. But mark
my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
towards Django or myself, you better be
prepared to die for it.
The two men ride off.
The Black and White Audience watch them go.

CUT TO.
CU SPENCER BENNETT
lying on his belly in the grass.
SPENCER BENNETT
That's them sonsabitches.
SPENCER'S POV:
We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set up.
Both wrapped up in bedrolls. The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers
lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.
We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER RIFLE
CARING MEN observing the camp, from over a grade.
The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came...
Where about TWENTY-FOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON HORSEBACK,
all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and mouth
holes cut out. Some carry TORCHES, all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
Spencer mounts his horse. "Big Daddy" issues orders astride his
steed..
SPENCER BENNETT
Now unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
personally, strip and clip that garboon
myself.
Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;
SPENCER BENNETT
Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
this thing.
He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make the
holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured.
BRADSHAW
We ready, or what?
3 7
SPENCER BENNETT
Hold on I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.
(RIPS)
Shit ...I just made it worse.
He rips. it off his head in frustration.
RANDY
I can't see shit either.
REDFISH
Who made this goddamn shit?
0. B.
Willards wife.
WILLARD
Well make you own goddamn masks!
SPENCER
(TO WILLARD)
Look nobody's saying they don't appreciate
what Jenny did.
REDFISH
Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I
could cut it better then this.
0. B.
How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?
ROBERT
Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head,
I can see you pretty good ... . more or less.
But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving
all over, and I'm riding blind.
Randy tears at his bag.
RANDY
Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
He puts it on-then says;
RANDY
Yep, it's worse.
He yanks it off his head.
RANDY
Did anybody bring any extra bags?
TERRY
No, no one brought a extra bag!
3 9
RANDY
I'm just asking.
DOUG
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?
SPENCER
Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
up, that just defeats the purpose.
Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.
REDFISH
I can't see in this fucking thing!
I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
And I can't ride in this fucking thing!
WILLARD
Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches!
And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
Willard rides off.
O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.
SPENCER
O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
not dead.
O.B.
But Willards riding off.
SPENCER
Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.
RANDY
Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
Robert takes off his bag, and says;
ROBERT
I think we all think the bags was a nice
idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
could of been done better. So how 'bout,
no bags this time, but next time, we do the
bags right, and then we go full regalia.
Everyone takes off their bag.
SPENCER
Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!
YO
TERRY
But nobody can see.
SPENCER
So?
TERRY
So, it would be nice to see.
SPENCER
Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
can't see, so what? All that matters is can
the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well.
EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over
the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.
WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS
OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" -
"Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell
off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."
Then amongst the confusion...
WE SNAP ZOOM TO
A BIG TREE
on the other side of the lake
Then quickly cut into The Tree.
Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ
with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye.
SCOPE SIGHT POV
The Yellow covered STICKS OF DYNAMITE protruding from the ground, are
inside the scope sight circle, Horse hooves step around it.
TWO SHOT
Dr.SCHtJLTZ and DJANGO up in a tree.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Auf wiedersehen.
L,
He fires.
The Camp EXPLODES Blowing Horses and Riders Apart.
Dr.Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Let 'em have it!
DJANGO
I can't see nothin'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Just fire into the smoke.
The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.
INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like
dogs.
SPENCER BENNETT
on his horse with the other fleeing regulators RIDES for his life...
SCOPE SIGHT POV
We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross hairs.
DJANGO
scope sight rifle up to his eye.
Schultz next to him, says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
He's getting away.
DJANGO
I got 'em.

INSERT: A black finger squeezes the rifle trigger.
SPENCER BENNETT
we're behind him as he rides away, OFF SCREEN we hear the whistling of
what sounds like an incoming missle.
SPENCER BENNETT
we're in.front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's bullet,
RIPS THROUGH his CHEST.
DJANGO
DJANGO
I got 'em.
SPENCER BENNETT
falls from his horse, dead.
DJANGO
scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks.to
Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like that, huh?
Referring to the scope sight rifle;
DJANGO
I like.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, I think while they take this opportunity
to lick their wounds, we should take this
opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee.
They hop out of the tree.
MONTAGE
Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets his
first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores to
purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django,
with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn
handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket,
Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.
He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright
on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as
his winter coat.
EXT - COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
Django, sitting on his new saddle, in his new duds, rides alongside
the good doctor Schultz. The German carries a PICNIC BASKET.
Dr.SCHULTZ
But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.
DJANGO
She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
were sayin' where I gotta go first?
Dr.SCHULTZ
There'should be some sort of records office.
You know when she was sold, you know where
she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
you know her name ... . what is her name?
DJANGO
Broomhilda.
Schultz reacts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda?
Django.nods his head yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Were her owners German?
Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?
DJANGO
Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
speak a little German too.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your wife?
DJANGO
Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So let me get this straight, your slave
wife speaks German, and her name is
Broomhilda Von Shaft...?
DJANGO
Yep. Mouthful, huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To say the least.
(stopping the horse)
This looks like a very pretty place to have
our picnic. What'd ya say, here?
TIME CUT
EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
cup of tea.
DJANGO
How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
were German?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
her, it stands to reason they'd be German.
DJANGO
Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
a character in one of the most popular of
all the German legends.
DJANGO
Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes there is.
DJANGO
Do you know it?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Every German knows that story. Would you
like me to tell you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
DJANGO
What she do.?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
him in some way. So at first he's just going to
obliterate her -
DJANGO
Obliterate... . what does that mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like blow up.
He pantomimes a explosion.
DJANGO
Phew, that's pretty mad.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
little time, he calms down a bit. He's
still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.
DJANGO
Broomhilda's on a mountain?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a German legend, there's always going
to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
arises brave enough to save her.
DJANGO
Does a fella arise?
From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
named, S
